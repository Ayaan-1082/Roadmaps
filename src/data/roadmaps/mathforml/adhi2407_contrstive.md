# Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)

## What is CPC ?
1. Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) learns self-supervised representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. 
2. The model uses a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples.

## What is contrastive learning?
Image result for Contrastive Predictive Coding resources
Contrastive Learning is a technique that enhances the performance of vision tasks by using the principle of contrasting samples against each other to learn attributes that are common between data classes and attributes that set apart a data class from another

## What is contrastive loss?
1. Contrastive Loss. Contrastive loss is one of the first training objectives that was used for contrastive learning.
2.  It takes as input a pair of samples that are either similar or dissimilar, and it brings similar samples closer and dissimilar samples far apart
