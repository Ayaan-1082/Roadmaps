# What are Eigenvalues?
The eigenvalue is explained to be a scalar associated with a linear set of equations which, when multiplied by a nonzero vector, equals to the vector obtained by transformation operating on the vector.

Let A be a linear transformation represented by a matrix A. If there is a vector X in R^n!=0 such that

# Steps to Find Eigenvalues of a Matrix
In order to find the eigenvalues of a matrix, follow the steps below:

Step 1: Make sure the given matrix A is a square matrix. Also, determine the identity matrix I of the same order.

Step 2: Estimate the matrix A – λI, where λ is a scalar quantity.

Step 3: Find the determinant of matrix A – λI and equate it to zero.

Step 4: From the equation thus obtained, calculate all the possible values of λ, which are the required eigenvalues of matrix A...<a href="https://byjus.com/jee/how-to-determine-the-eigenvalues-of-a-matrix/#:~:text=What%20are%20Eigenvalues%3F,transformation%20operating%20on%20the%20vector.&text=Here%2C%20%CE%BB%20is%20considered%20to%20be%20the%20eigenvalue%20of%20matrix%20A.">Read more</a>
