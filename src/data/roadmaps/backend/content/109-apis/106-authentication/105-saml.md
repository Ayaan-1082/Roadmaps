# Saml

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based open standard used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, particularly between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).

In other words, SAML enables secure and seamless access to multiple applications and services using a single set of login credentials. It eliminates the need for users to manage multiple usernames and passwords for different applications, while also ensuring that the user's identity is verified and trusted by the service provider.

SAML is widely used in enterprise environments, cloud computing, and web-based applications to enable single sign-on (SSO) and facilitate secure information exchange.
