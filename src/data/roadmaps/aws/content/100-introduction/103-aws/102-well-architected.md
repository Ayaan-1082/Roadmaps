# Well Architected Framework

AWS Well-Architected Framework is a set of strategic guidelines provided by Amazon Web Services. It is designed to provide high-performing and resilient systems while maintaining cost efficiency. The framework divides the architectural best practices across six pillars which include operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization and the newly introduced sustainability pillar. With this framework, you can assess and improve your cloud-based architectures and applications by leveraging AWS technologies. These are some explanation for the six pillars of AWS Well Architected Framewrok:

1. Operational Excellence Pillar
The operational excellence pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems, and continually improving processes and procedures. Key topics include automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations.

2. Security Pillar
The security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, managing user permissions, and establishing controls to detect security events.

3. Reliability Pillar
The reliability pillar focuses on workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover quickly from failure to meet demands. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, and adapting to changing requirements.

4. Performance Efficiency Pillar
The performance efficiency pillar focuses on structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources. Key topics include selecting resource types and sizes optimized for workload requirements, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business needs evolve.

5.Cost Optimization Pillar
The cost optimization pillar focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs. Key topics include understanding spending over time and controlling fund allocation, selecting resources of the right type and quantity, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.

6. Sustainability Pillar
The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. Key topics include a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts.
