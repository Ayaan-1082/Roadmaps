In Amazon Web Services (AWS), the concept of 'Shared Responsibility' pertains to the distribution of security and compliance responsibilities between AWS and the user/client. Under this model, AWS is responsible for the security "of" the cloud — including the infrastructure, hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS cloud services. On the other hand, the user is responsible for security "in" the cloud — this includes managing and configuring the customer-controlled services, protecting account credentials, and securing customer data. This shared model aims to lessen the operational burden for users and provide flexible security controls.
