# Exponential

Exponential algorithms are those that grow at a rate of 2^n. This means that for each additional input, the algorithm will take twice as long to run. The following function is an example of an exponential algorithm:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if((n==1) or (n==2)):
        return  1
    if(n > 2):
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

As you can see, the algorithm's runtime grows exponentially. For each additional input, the algorithm will take twice as long to run.
