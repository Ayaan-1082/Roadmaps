# Depth First Search

Depth First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The process starts at the root (in the case of a tree) or an arbitrary node (in case of a graph), and explores as far as possible along each branch before retracing steps. Essentially, DFS is about diving deep into the tree/graph from a starting point, and when no more nodes are left to explore, it backtracks, moving up the tree/graph. This repeat until all nodes have been visited. This algorithm is often used in simulation of game states, solving puzzles and finding connected components in a graph.
