# Breadth First Search

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a searching algorithm that's used in tree or graph data structures. It starts from the root (the topmost node in the tree) and expands all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This technique uses a queue data structure to remember to explore the next vertex or node and every edge that leads to a vertex will be explored, which ensures the discovery of every vertex reachable from the source. BFS is complete in nature, which means if the searched node is in the tree, BFS is guaranteed to find it.
