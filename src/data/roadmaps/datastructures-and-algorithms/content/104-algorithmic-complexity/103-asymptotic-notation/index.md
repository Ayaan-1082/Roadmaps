# Asymptotic Notation

In computer science, **asymptotic notation** is used to describe the efficiency of algorithms for large inputs. It is the mathematical notation of the growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity. The most commonly used notations are *O-notation* (Big O), *Ω-notation* (Omega), and *Θ-notation* (Theta). Big O notation provides an upper bound of the complexity in the worst-case, giving an approximated maximum amount of time taken by an algorithm for any input. Omega notation provides a lower bound of the complexity in the best-case, whereas Theta notation defines a tight bound giving both the lower and upper bound. These notational systems allow for a comparison of the efficiency of algorithms without considering the effect of hardware or software related factors.
