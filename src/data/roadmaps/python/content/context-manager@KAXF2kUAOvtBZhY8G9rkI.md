Context managers are a contruct in Python that allows you to set up context for a block of code, and then automatically clean up or relase resources when the block is exited. It is most commonly used with the `with` statement.

**Example**:

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
  content = file.read()
```
Context managers are a powerful feature that ensure proper resource management, which is crucial for tasks like file handling, network connections, and managing locks in threading.
