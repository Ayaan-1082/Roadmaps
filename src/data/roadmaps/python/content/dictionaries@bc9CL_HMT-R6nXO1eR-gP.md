# Dictionaries

n Python, a dictionary is a built-in data type that allows you to store key-value pairs. Each key in the dictionary is unique,
and each key is associated with a value. Dictionaries are unordered collections, meaning the order of items is not guaranteed.

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
