# Loops

In Python, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are two primary types of loops:  

1.for Loop-  The for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes the code block for each item in the sequence.

2. while Loop- The while loop executes the code block as long as the condition is True. It's important to ensure that the condition eventually becomes False to avoid an infinite loop.
