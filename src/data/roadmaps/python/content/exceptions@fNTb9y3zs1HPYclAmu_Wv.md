# Exceptions

Python exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program and disrupt the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception is raised, it indicates that an error has occurred. Python provides a way to handle these exceptions using try-except blocks, allowing developers to manage errors gracefully and ensure the program can continue or exit smoothly.
