# Constructs

In Rust, **constructs** refer to different elements used to build the structure of the program. Constructs includes variables, functions, data types, control flow statements, and more.

- **Variables** store data, and their immutable or mutable status is determined at their declaration with `let` and `let mut`, respectively.
- **Functions** are reusable blocks of code defined by the `fn` keyword.
- **Data types** in Rust are static and must be declared upfront. These include simple _primitive_ types, like integers, booleans (`bool`), and floats, as well as complex types like arrays, tuples, all the custom types you define yourself, and many more types included in Rust's standard library or definined in any community crates you use.
- **Control flow** structures help direct the flow of code execution. These include `if`, `else`, `loop`, `while`, and `for` blocks, to name a few. Exception handling in Rust leverages the `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>` enums alongside the `match` construct's ability to perform concise pattern matching.

As a Rust programmer, you'll utilize many of the language's constructs like the ones above. These pieces come together at your fingertips to structure your program in a safe and efficient manner.
