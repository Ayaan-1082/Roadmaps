# IDEs

The concept of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) traces its roots back to the 1960s and 1970s when basic text editors and simple programming tools were used in early computing. The first notable IDEs emerged with the rise of Unix systems in the 1970s, such as the EMACS text editor, which included features like code editing and debugging.

In the 1980s, with the growth of personal computing, IDEs became more advanced. Turbo Pascal, introduced by Borland, set a new standard by offering a fast, compiled programming environment. Microsoft and Apple followed suit, integrating more sophisticated tools into their ecosystems. As development workflows became more complex, IDEs evolved to include debugging, testing, and source control capabilities.

Today, IDEs have become essential for developers, supporting multiple programming languages and integrating cloud-based tools, continuous integration, and real-time collaboration. IDEs like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse are widely adopted by developers across industries.
