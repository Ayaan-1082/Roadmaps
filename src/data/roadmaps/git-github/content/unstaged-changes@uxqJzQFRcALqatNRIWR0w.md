# Unstaged Changes

For changes that are not yet staged with `git add`, such as untracked new files or modified existing ones, use `git diff --unified`. This command compares your working directory against the latest committed version of each file. It's a useful tool for reviewing any local modifications before deciding whether to stage them for future commits.
