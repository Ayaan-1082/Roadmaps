### Let us see an example : North Star Metric for a Social Media Platform
Company: Social Media Platform (let’s call it "Let Us Meet")
Goal: To grow user engagement and satisfaction.
North Star Metric: Daily Active Users (DAU) who post content

### Reasoning:

Alignment with Mission: Let Us Meet's mission is to foster communication and sharing among users. The NSM of DAU who post content directly measures user engagement, which is central to their mission.
Focus on Value: If users are actively posting content, it indicates they are finding value in the platform, leading to higher engagement and retention.
Actionable: The DAU who post content metric can drive actionable insights. If this number drops, the company might investigate potential issues in user experience, content creation tools, or engagement features.
Growth Indicator: An increase in this metric suggests that users are not just passively consuming content but are actively engaging with the platform, which is likely to drive overall growth.

How to Use the North Star Metric:

Set Goals: For instance, aim to increase DAU who post content by 20% over the next quarter.
Align Teams: Ensure all teams (product development, marketing, customer support) understand how their work impacts the NSM.
Track Progress: Regularly monitor the DAU who post content to gauge the effectiveness of different strategies and initiatives.

In summary, the North Star Metric helps focus efforts on what matters most for growth and alignment with the company's mission.
For Let Us Meet, DAU who post content is a clear, actionable measure that reflects user engagement and platform success.
