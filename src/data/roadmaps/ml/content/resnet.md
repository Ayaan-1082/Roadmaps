# Resnet
    A residual neural network (ResNet) is an artificial neural network (ANN). It is a gateless or open-gated variant of the HighwayNet, the first working very deep feedforward neural network with hundreds of layers, much deeper than previous neural networks.

# Residual Network
    In order to solve the problem of the vanishing/exploding gradient, this architecture introduced the concept called Residual Blocks. In this network, we use a technique called skip connections. The skip connection connects activations of a  layer to further layers by skipping some layers in between. This forms a residual block. Resnets are made by stacking these residual blocks together. 

    F(x) := H(x) - x which gives H(x) := F(x) + x.
