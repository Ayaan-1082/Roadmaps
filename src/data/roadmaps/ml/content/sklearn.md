# Sci-Kit Learn

## Why We Use Scikit-Learn For Machine Learning?

- Whether you are just looking for an introduction to ML, want to get up and running fast, or are looking for the latest ML research tool, you will find that scikit-learn is both well-documented and easy to learn/use.

- As a high-level library, it lets you define a predictive data model in just a few lines of code, and then use that model to fit your data. 

- Itâ€™s versatile and integrates well with other Python libraries, such as matplotlib for plotting, numpy for array vectorization, and pandas for dataframes.

## USER INSTALLATION
If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy, the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using pip:
``` python
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

## DEPENDENCIES:

scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= 3.8)
- NumPy (>= 1.17.3)
- SciPy (>= 1.3.2)
- joblib (>= 1.1.1)
- threadpoolctl (>= 2.0.0)

Scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. scikit-learn 1.0 and later require Python 3.7 or newer. scikit-learn 1.1 and later require Python 3.8 or newer.

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with plot_ and classes end with "Display") require Matplotlib (>= 3.1.3). For running the examples Matplotlib >= 3.1.3 is required. A few examples require scikit-image >= 0.16.2, a few examples require pandas >= 1.0.5, some examples require seaborn >= 0.9.0 and plotly >= 5.10.0.

## DEVELOPMENT:

- We welcome new contributors of all experience levels. The scikit-learn community goals are to be helpful, welcoming, and effective.
- The Development Guide has detailed information about contributing code, documentation, tests, and more. We've included some basic information in this README.

After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the source directory (you will need to have pytest >= 5.3.1 installed):

``` python
pytest sklearn
```
