# Serverless

Serverless Computing Is a Cloud Computing Model in Which Server Management and Infrastructure Decisions Are Abstracted Away From Application Developers. This Approach Allows Developers to Focus Solely on Their Code, as the Cloud Provider Dynamically Manages Resource Allocation. The key Feature of Serverless Computing Is That It Enables Applications to Be Hosted Without the Need for Maintaining Physical Servers or Virtual Machines.

### Key Characteristics of Serverless Computing

- No Server Management: Developers Are Relieved From the Responsibilities of Server Maintenance and Management.
- Automatic Scaling: The Serverless Platform Adjusts Computing Resources Automatically Based on the Applicationâ€™s Needs, Ensuring Efficient Handling of Varying Workloads.
- Usage-Based Billing: Costs Are Calculated Based on the Actual Consumption of Resources, Rather Than Pre-Allocated Server Capacity.

### Applications of Serverless Computing

- Microservices and API Backends: Ideal for Building and Managing Microservices Architectures and API Backends Without the Need to Worry About the Underlying Infrastructure.
- Event-Driven Workflows: Facilitates the Development of Applications That Respond to Events and Triggers, Making them suitable for IoT Applications, Data Processing Tasks, and More.
