# Code Coverage

The Angular CLI can run unit tests and create code coverage reports. Code coverage reports show you any parts of your code base that might not be properly tested by your unit tests.

To generate a coverage report run the following command in the root of your project: 

```
ng test --no-watch --code-coverage
```
