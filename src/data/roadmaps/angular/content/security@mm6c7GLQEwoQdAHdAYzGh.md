# Security
This topic describes Angular's built-in protections against common web-application vulnerabilities and attacks such as cross-site scripting attacks. It doesn't cover application-level security, such as authentication and authorization.

These are some best practices to ensure that your Angular application is secure:
- Keep current with the latest Angular library releases
- Don't alter your copy of Angular
- Avoid Angular APIs marked in the documentation as "Security Risk"
