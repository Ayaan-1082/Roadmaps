# Angular Architecture

Angular follows a modular architecture pattern, dividing the application into distinct modules, components, services, and other elements. This approach enhances code organization and maintainability.

## Key Building Blocks

- Modules: Containers grouping related components, services, directives, and other elements. They ensure proper encapsulation and reusability.
- Components: The building blocks of Angular applications, representing parts of the user interface with associated logic. They consist of templates, styles, and a class defining behavior.
- Services: Encapsulate reusable business logic, data manipulation, and API communication. They enable data and functionality sharing across components.
- Directives: HTML attributes or elements extending HTML functionality, allowing reusable behaviors across the application.
- Pipes: Transform data before displaying it in templates, providing convenient ways to format, filter, and sort data.
