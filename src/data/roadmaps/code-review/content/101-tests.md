# Questions to Ask

- Are all tests passing?
- Are new features reasonably tested?
- Are corner cases tested?
- Is it using unit tests where possible, integration tests where necessary?
- Are there tests for [NFRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement), e.g. performance, memory analysis?
