# OOP

Object-oriented programming is a core of Java Programming, which is used for designing a program using classes and objects. This can also be characterized as data controlling for accessing the code.
Classes can be defined as the template to create objects and objects can be classified as physical reality from which data controlling is done.
Class name should always start with the capital letter.

There are four pillars of object-oriented programming -
Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation.
Java does not support multiple inheritance. Interfaces are used in java for multiple inheritance.
