# How JVM Works

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a program that executes Java bytecode. JVMs are available for various hardware and software platforms, making them platform-dependent but the programs themselves - not. The so-called "Write once run everywhere" becomes true here. The JVM is responsible for calling the main method in Java code and is a crucial part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

While primarily designed for Java, the JVM can run any language that compiles to Java bytecode. This flexibility allows other languages like Kotlin, Scala, and Groovy to leverage the JVM ecosystem.

Multiple JVM implementations exist, each with unique features. Oracle's HotSpot is the standard implementation, while GraalVM is a high-performance alternative that's gaining popularity. GraalVM offers enhanced performance.
