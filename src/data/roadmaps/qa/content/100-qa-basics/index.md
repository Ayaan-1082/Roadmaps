# Learn the Fundamentals

QA, or Quality Assurance, is the process of ensuring that a product or service meets certain quality standards or specifications. In general, QA involves a set of activities and processes that are designed to prevent or identify defects, errors, or other issues in a product or service before it is released to customers or end-users.

Here are some basic concepts related to QA:

**Testing:** The process of verifying that a product or service meets the expected requirements or specifications. Testing can be done manually or through automated tools.

**Defect:** An issue or problem in a product or service that prevents it from functioning as expected or meeting the desired quality standards.

**Bug:** Another term for defect or issue in a product or service.

**Test case:** A specific set of instructions or conditions that a tester follows to ensure that a product or service is working as expected.

**Regression testing:** A type of testing that is performed to ensure that changes or updates to a product or service do not negatively impact existing functionality.

**Test plan:** A document that outlines the testing strategy, approach, and objectives for a product or service.

**Test suite:** A collection of test cases that are designed to test a specific aspect of a product or service.

**Test environment:** The hardware, software, and other resources that are used to perform testing activities.

**Verification and validation:** Two related but distinct activities that are performed as part of the QA process. Verification is the process of ensuring that a product or service meets the specified requirements, while validation is the process of ensuring that a product or service meets the actual needs and expectations of customers or end-users.

**Quality control:** The process of monitoring and controlling the quality of a product or service throughout its development and release lifecycle.
