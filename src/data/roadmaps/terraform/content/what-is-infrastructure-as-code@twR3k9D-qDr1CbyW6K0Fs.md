# What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. IaC is a key DevOps practice and helps automate infrastructure provisioning and management, ensuring consistency and reducing errors.

**Benefits of IaC:**
**Speed and Efficiency:** Rapid provisioning and scaling of infrastructure.
**Cost Reduction:** Reduced manual effort and errors leading to lower operational costs.
**Improved Collaboration:** Developers and operations teams can work together using the same language and tools.
**Environment Parity:** Ensures that development, testing, and production environments are consistent.

Below is a YouTube link that explains the IaC concept.
