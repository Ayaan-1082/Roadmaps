# Variables

Terraform uses variables to make configurations more flexible and reusable. Variables can be declared in `.tf` files and assigned values through various methods, including default values, command-line flags, environment variables, or separate `.tfvars` files. They support multiple data types such as string, number, bool, list, and map. Variables can be referenced throughout the configuration using the `var` prefix. This system enables infrastructure as code to be more dynamic and adaptable to different environments or use cases.
