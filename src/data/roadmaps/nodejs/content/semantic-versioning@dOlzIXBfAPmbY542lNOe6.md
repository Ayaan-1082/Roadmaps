# Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning (often abbreviated as **SemVer**) is a versioning scheme used in software development to manage version numbers of software releases. In Node.js, and many other programming environments, semantic versioning helps developers understand the impact of changes in a software package or library based on its version number.

The version number is typically expressed in the form of **`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`**, where each part of the version number has a specific meaning:

1. **MAJOR** version (`X.0.0`): 
   - Incremented when there are incompatible API changes. 
   - For example, if the update introduces breaking changes that could potentially cause existing code to fail, the MAJOR version number is increased.

2. **MINOR** version (`0.Y.0`): 
   - Incremented when new functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.
   - This means that existing code using the previous version will still work without modification.

3. **PATCH** version (`0.0.Z`): 
   - Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.
   - These are small fixes that don’t affect the API or add new features but resolve issues in the existing functionality.

### Example
If a Node.js package is versioned as `2.3.4`:
- `2` is the MAJOR version.
- `3` is the MINOR version.
- `4` is the PATCH version.

If a breaking change is introduced, the next version might be `3.0.0`. If a new feature is added without breaking anything, the next version might be `2.4.0`. If a bug is fixed, the version might be `2.3.5`.

### Using Semantic Versioning in Node.js
When using Node.js and managing dependencies in your `package.json` file, you’ll often see version numbers with ranges like `^1.2.3` or `~1.2.3`:
- `^1.2.3` allows updates to any version that does not change the leftmost non-zero digit, meaning it allows updates from `1.2.3` to any `1.x.x` version.
- `~1.2.3` allows updates to the patch level, so it would allow updates from `1.2.3` to any `1.2.x` version.

Semantic Versioning helps maintain stability in your projects by clearly indicating the level of change that each new release introduces.
