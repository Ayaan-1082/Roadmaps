# Required Utility Type in TypeScript

The `Required` utility type in TypeScript helps you make all properties of an object type mandatory. This means that after using `Required`, you must provide values for all the properties of that type.

## Syntax

```javascript
Required<Type>
```

- **Type**: The object type you want to make all properties required for.

## How to Use `Required`

### Simple Example

Let's start with a simple example to understand how `Required` works:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name?: string;
  email?: string;
}

// Using the User interface as it is
let user1: User = { id: 1 }; // name and email are optional
let user2: User = { id: 2, name: "Alice" }; // email is optional

// Applying Required to User
type RequiredUser = Required<User>;

// Now, all properties are required
let user3: RequiredUser = { id: 3, name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" };
// This will throw an error if you omit name or email
```

In this example:
- The `User` interface has optional properties `name` and `email`.
- We use `Required<User>` to create a new type `RequiredUser`, where `name` and `email` are now mandatory.
- When creating a `RequiredUser` object, you must provide values for `id`, `name`, and `email`.

### Example with Nested Objects

Now, let's see how `Required` works with nested objects:

```typescript
interface Profile {
  username?: string;
  bio?: string;
}

interface User {
  id: number;
  profile?: Profile;
}

// Applying Required to User
type RequiredUser = Required<User>;

// profile is required, but its properties are still optional
let user1: RequiredUser = {
  id: 1,
  profile: { username: "john_doe" } // 'bio' is still optional within profile
};

// Making everything fully required, including nested properties
type FullyRequiredUser = Required<RequiredUser>;

let user2: FullyRequiredUser = {
  id: 2,
  profile: { username: "jane_doe", bio: "Developer" } // Now 'bio' is required
};
```

In this example:
- `Required<User>` makes `profile` required, but `profile`'s properties (`username` and `bio`) are still optional.
- `Required<RequiredUser>` makes all properties, including those in `profile`, required.

## When to Use `Required`

You can use the `Required` utility type when you need to make sure all properties of an object are provided. This is useful:
- When you have forms where every field needs to be filled out.
- When copying objects and you want to ensure all fields are copied.
- When validating data to make sure all properties are present.

## Conclusion

The `Required` utility type in TypeScript is a handy tool to make sure all properties of an object are required. It helps catch errors early and makes your code more reliable.
