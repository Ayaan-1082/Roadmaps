Here's what GSAP is known for:

Animating Anything:
GSAP can animate almost anything that JavaScript can touch, including UI, SVG, and any numeric property of any JS object.

Timeline-Based Animations:
GSAP allows you to tween CSS properties, attributes, and values over time, and then insert those tweens into a timeline for more complex animations.

Performance:
GSAP is known for its ultra-high performance and works in all major browsers.

Functionality and Plugins:
GSAP offers a wide range of functionality and plugins, including MorphSVG, SplitText, and ScrollSmoother.

Ease of Use:
GSAP is considered straightforward to use, even for complex movements, and can be used within WebGL, Canvas, and Three.js contexts.

GSAP can be used to make elements appear, move, fade, spin, and more. It interpolates between starting and ending values 60 times per second, creating smooth and seamless animations.
