REPLACE AND SUBSTITUTE

The Replace method is commonly used for tasks such as correcting typos, updating outdated information, and standardizing data formats across a worksheet. For example, it can be used to change all instances of an old product name to a new one in a sales report. The Substitute method is particularly useful for making targeted text replacements within cells. For instance, it can replace the second occurrence of a specific word within a text string, which is useful in complex data entries where only certain instances of a term need alteration. These methods are essential for data cleaning, ensuring consistency, and preparing data for analysis, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of data handling in Excel.
