# Navigation Stacks
A view that displays a root view and enables you to present additional views over the root view.
Use a navigation stack to present a stack of views over a root view. People can add views to the top of the stack by clicking or tapping a NavigationLink, and remove views using built-in, platform-appropriate controls, like a Back button or a swipe gesture. The stack always displays the most recently added view that hasn’t been removed, and doesn’t allow the root view to be removed.
