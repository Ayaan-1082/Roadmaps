# Core OS

The Core OS layer in iOS is the foundation upon which the entire operating system is built, providing essential low-level services that ensure the systemâ€™s security, performance, and efficiency.

**Kernel and Device Drivers**
- Kernel: Manages system resources, security, hardware abstraction (XNU kernel).
- Device Drivers: Facilitate communication between the OS and hardware devices.

**Security Frameworks**
- Secure Enclave: Handles encryption keys and biometric data securely.
- Keychain Services: Secure storage for passwords, keys, and sensitive data.

**File System**
- APFS (Apple File System): Modern file system with features like encryption, snapshotting, and space sharing.

**Memory Management**
- Efficient use of physical and virtual memory to maintain application performance.

**Networking**
- Low-level networking capabilities, support for various protocols, secure communication channels.

**Power Management**
- Features to extend battery life, such as App Nap and power-saving modes.

**Inter-process Communication (IPC)**
- Mechanisms for processes to communicate and share data, essential for multitasking.

**LibSystem**
- Core system libraries, including libdispatch (concurrency), libxpc (IPC), and libsystem.

## Key Functions

- **Resource Management:** Efficient use of CPU, memory, storage.
- **Security Enforcement:** Sandboxing, encryption, secure boot.
- **Hardware Abstraction:** Simplifies hardware interaction for higher-level software.
- **Performance Optimization:** Memory allocation, task scheduling, power management.
- **System Services:** Networking, file system access, IPC.
