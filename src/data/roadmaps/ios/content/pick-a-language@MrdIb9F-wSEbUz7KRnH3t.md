# Pick a Language

Apple used to use Objective C for the development of apps for iOS and macOS, but since 2014 [Swift](https://www.swift.org/documentation/) became the primary language for app development. After more than 10 years of growing strong and mature, now it is worth starting your iOS Developer journey by learning the language.

Swift is an object-oriented programming language with some functional programming flavors to it. For someone with a coding background in C++ and Java, the strange concepts would be Optionals, Closures, and the very fact you can skip writing semicolons when you end your statements. Otherwise, it is a very easy and understandable language with ridiculously simple syntax to be familiar with. If you are not yet conviced why you should choose Swift over Objective C [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3CKQajX99M) by [Brian Voong](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com) explains the reasons briefly.
