# IBActions

The @IBAction attribute functions similarly to @IBOutlet. It serves as a hint, prompting Xcode to make the associated method available in the Interface Builder. If you inspect the Interface Builder, you'll notice that it recognizes the method: edit Main.storyboard, select the View Controller object, and switch to the Connections inspector. There, under Received Actions, youâ€™ll see buttonPressed: listed, which is the Objective-C representation of our action method.
