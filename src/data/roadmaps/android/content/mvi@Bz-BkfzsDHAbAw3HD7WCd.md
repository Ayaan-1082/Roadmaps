The **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** architecture is a design pattern introduced in Android development to facilitate the development of scalable and maintainable applications.

Inspired by the Cycle.js framework, MVI follows the unidirectional and cyclic flow principle, wherein data flows through a predictable sequence of steps: Model, View, and Intent.

**Components of MVI Architecture**
The MVI Android architecture consists of three main components: Model, View, and Intent. Each element has distinct responsibilities and contributes to the application’s structure and behavior.

**Model**
This is the heart of your app. It holds all the data and rules (business logic). The Model is like a set of instructions that can’t be changed (immutable), ensuring the app behaves predictably. When something changes in the app, the Model updates its state, but the old state remains unchanged.

**View**
Think of this as the app’s face. It shows the user interface (UI) – everything the user sees and interacts with. The View monitors the Model and changes the UI to match the Model’s state.

It’s a one-way mirror; it sees changes in the Model but doesn’t change them. The View also notices the user’s actions, like tapping buttons or typing text.

**Intent**
‘Intent’ doesn’t mean the same thing as typical Android development. In MVI, an Intent is more about the user’s actions or wishes.

When a user does something in the View, like clicking a button, that action is turned into an Intent. This Intent is sent to the Model as a request or signal to do something or change.
