#MVVM 
Model-View-Viewmodel(MVVM) is an architecture pattern taht seperates the data presentation logic from the core buisness logic in Android development. It mainly used to organise the code in better way and helps developers to easily update code easily. It consists of three main components:
_Model_:Represents the data from the buisness logic.It might be a database or APIs etc..
_View: Represents the user interface elements..
_Viewmodel_: Acts as a link between the Model and View,handling UI-related logic
This architecture doesnt allow any module or function to directly make changes to the data or ui layer,instead Viewmodel recieves the user input and makes the changes to the data layer or UI layer. This architecture pattern is widely used in software development processes. It can reduces the boiler-plate codes.

Maintaining a better architecture always helps to build a robust and easily maintainable software.Choose right architecture based on your project requirements.
