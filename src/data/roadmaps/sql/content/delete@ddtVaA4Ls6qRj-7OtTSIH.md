# DELETE

The `DELETE` statement is used to remove existing rows from a table. In addition, conditions can be applied & executed via a query like so:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
Omitting the `WHERE` clause will **delete all rows** in the table, and this action is irreversible.
