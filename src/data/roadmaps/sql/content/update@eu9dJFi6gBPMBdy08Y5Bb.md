The `INSERT` statement in SQL is a fundamental command used to add new records, or rows, to a database table. Understanding how to use `INSERT` is essential for anyone working with databases, as it allows you to populate tables with data that can later be queried, updated, or deleted. 

### Basic Syntax
The basic syntax of an `INSERT` statement is as follows:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

- **`table_name`**: This is the name of the table where you want to insert the new data.
- **`column1, column2, ...`**: These are the specific columns in the table where you want to insert the data. You specify the columns to ensure that the values are inserted into the correct locations.
- **`value1, value2, ...`**: These are the actual data values that you want to insert into the specified columns. The order of the values must match the order of the columns listed.

The `INSERT` statement is powerful and versatile, enabling you to add new data to your tables with precision. Whether you are inserting a single row or multiple rows, understanding how to use this command effectively is key to managing data in your SQL databases.
