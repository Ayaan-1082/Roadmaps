# UPDATE

The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing data in a given table. <br/>
it can be done so with the query

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

- _keep in mind that **SET** and **WHERE** are also commands to assign a new value(SET) only if the condition is met(WHERE)_

⚠️ &nbsp; Omitting the `WHERE` clause will update **all** rows in the table.
