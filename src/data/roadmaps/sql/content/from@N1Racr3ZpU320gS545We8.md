The `FROM` clause in SQL is used to specify the table from which to retrieve the data. It's a crucial part of a SQL query as it indicates the source of the data to be selected, updated, or deleted.

The `FROM` clause can be used with various SQL statements such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. When combined with a `SELECT` statement, it identifies the table(s) from which to retrieve the data.

### Basic Example

Here's an example of a basic `FROM` clause in a `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

In this example, the query selects all columns (`*`) from the table named `Students`.

### Combining with Multiple Tables

The `FROM` clause can also be used to specify multiple tables in a query, especially when performing joins between tables. For example:

```sql
SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName
FROM Students
JOIN Courses ON Students.CourseID = Courses.CourseID;
```

In this example, the query retrieves the names of students along with the courses they are enrolled in by joining the `Students` and `Courses` tables.

### Syntax

The syntax of the `FROM` clause generally looks like this:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

In this syntax:

- `column1, column2, ...` specifies the columns to be selected.
- `table_name` specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.

The `FROM` clause is essential in identifying where the data is coming from, making it a fundamental part of any SQL query.
