# Compliance

Compliance in cybersecurity establishes operational standards by ensuring organizations follow guidelines like policies and frameworks. The Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) framework helps implement these regulations. Compliance is crucial to prevent companies from neglecting security measures, ensuring systems are secure. Key standards include HIPAA, NIST CSF, PCI DSS, and GDPR, focusing on protecting sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial information, and Protected Health Information (PHI). Understanding industry-specific compliance requirements is vital for protecting both customer data and internal records.
