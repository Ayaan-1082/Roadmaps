# Compliance

Compliance in cybersecurity forms the foundation for operational standards. It ensures that organizations meet established guidelines, which include policies, baselines, and frameworks.

Organizations typically follow the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) framework. This framework guides the implementation of other frameworks, compliance regulations, and policies.

Compliance plays a crucial role in cybersecurity. Without regulations, many companies might neglect necessary security measures. Compliance ensures that systems are patched, and secure policies are in place.

Some key standards include:

- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- NIST CSF (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework)
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- Sarbanes-Oxley Act
- EU GDPR (European Union General Data Protection Regulation)
- Basel Accords for banks
- GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)
- FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)

Most cybersecurity laws focus on protecting sensitive data, which generally falls into three categories: Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial information, and Protected Health Information (PHI).

- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** typically includes date of birth, full name, address, and Social Security number.
- **Financial Information** often includes credit card numbers, expiration dates, CVV codes, bank account details, PINs, and credit history.
- **Protected Health Information (PHI)** usually encompasses medical history, insurance records, appointment history, prescription records, and hospital admission records.

Other types of sensitive information that may fall under compliance requirements include race, religion, marital status, IP addresses, email addresses, usernames, passwords, and biometric data.

It's important to research compliance requirements specific to your company's industry and the types of information it processes. Compliance isn't just about customer or consumer security; it also covers the protection of internal documents, files, and employee records.
