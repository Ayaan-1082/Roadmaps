# MITRE D3FEND

**MITRE D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defenses)** is a knowledge graph of countermeasure techniques developed by the MITRE Corporation with support from National Security Agency (NSA). It provides a standardized language and framework for defensive techniques.

## D3FEND Components

- The **model** develops representations of entities, behaviors, and environments to improve understanding and analysis.
- **Hardening** involves decreasing the attack surface, securing configurations, and ensuring systems are protected from cyber threats.
- **Detection** involves identifying and discovering potential threats or malicious activities within a network.
- **Isolation** contains the threat to prevent it from spreading or escalating.
- **Deception** involves misleading attackers and diverting them away from assets.
- **Eviction** removes the threat from the network entirely.
- **Restoration** returns systems and operations to their normal state.

## D3FEND Matrix

D3FEND Matrix is a complementary tool for ATT&CK framework and offers a systematic approach to understand and implement defensive countermeasures against cyber threats. It provides guidance on how to defend against outlined adversarial actions in the matrix.

## Real-World Application

- **Product Comparison and Gap Analysis**: D3FEND allows organizations to evaluate the functionalities of various cybersecurity products. Using a standardized taxonomy of defensive techniques, stakeholders can precisely identify differences and gaps between products, facilitating better decision-making when acquiring new solutions.
- **Defining Testing Scope**: The framework aids in developing offensive test plans by linking defensive techniques to associated offensive strategies. This method offers a detailed insight into the effectiveness of a defensive product's claimed capabilities, helping organizations to accurately validate their cybersecurity defenses.
