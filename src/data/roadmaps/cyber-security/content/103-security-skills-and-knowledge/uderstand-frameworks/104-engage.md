# MITRE Engage

MITRE Engage is a framework that provides active defense for adversary engagement in cyber security. It is generally integrated to ATT&CK framework, it focuses on adversary engagement, areas of denial and deception.

##Â What is active defense?

Active defense consists of offensive terms to slow down or outsmart malicious actors and making it more costly for attackers with deception and to make defense less costly in cyber security. Apart from defensive methodology, active defense utilizes striking back to malicious actors but it is generally reserved for law enforcement agencies and military as they have the necessary resources and authority on their disposal.
