# MITRE Engage

MITRE Engage is a framework that provides active defense for adversary engagement in cyber security. It is generally integrated to ATT&CK framework, it focuses on adversary engagement, areas of denial and deception.

##Â What is active defense?

Active defense consists of offensive terms to slow down or outsmart malicious actors and making it more costly for attackers with deception and to make defense less costly in cyber security. Apart from defensive methodology, active defense utilizes striking back to malicious actors but it is generally reserved for law enforcement agencies and military as they have the necessary resources and authority on their disposal.

## MITRE Engage Process and Components

MITRE Engage composes of five steps: Prepare, Expose, Affect, Elicit and Understand. 

- **Prepare**: This is where organization prepare to engage with adversaries where they gather Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), defining their engagement environment, gating criterion and deciding on operational objectives and the creation of personas, storyboarding and building a threat model.
- **Expose**: In expose phase, monitoring and manipulation data are collected and detection of vulnerabilities, lures, malware detonation and network analysis is conducted.
- **Affect**: In affect phase, prevention, directing and disrupting cyber attacks come in play. In this phase, we want to prevent manipulations, isolation and compromise of security controls, directing attack network, lures and other traps set up by the organization. Finally, we aim to disrupt our adversaries by isolation, lures and manipulation their networks and software.
- **Elicit**: Elicit phase involves reassurance and motivation of application, artifact and network diversities, reassuring burn-in, email and information manipulation, peripheral management and pocket litter. And in motivation, we motivate attackers to detonate malware and our persona is motivated.
- **Understand**: It is the last step of the Engage Process and it involves analyzing after-action review, updating our CTI and analyzing and updating our threat model if necessary.
