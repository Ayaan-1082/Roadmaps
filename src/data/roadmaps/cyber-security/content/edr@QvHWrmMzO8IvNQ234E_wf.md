# EDR: Endpoint Detection and Response

**EDR** stands for Endpoint Detection and Response. It's a cybersecurity technology that continuously monitors your devices (like computers, laptops, and mobile phones) for suspicious activity to prevent cyberattacks. 

## How does EDR work?

-   **Continuous monitoring**: EDR solutions constantly watch for unusual behavior on your devices. 
  
-   **Threat detection**: When something suspicious happens, EDR alerts security teams.   

-   **Investigation**: Security teams can use EDR to analyze the threat and understand how it got in.  

-   **Response**: EDR can automatically take actions to contain the threat, like blocking malicious files or isolating infected devices.

## Benefits of EDR:

-   **Improved threat visibility**: Gain deeper insights into cyberattacks.

-   **Faster incident response**: Quickly detect and respond to threats.

-   **Reduced risk**: Protect your sensitive data and systems.

-   **Compliance**: Help meet regulatory requirements.
