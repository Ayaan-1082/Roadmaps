# Phishing

The technique where scammers pretend to be trusted organizations like your *bank*, *online retailers* or a *government office* in order to trick you into sharing your personal information like bank passcode, credit card number, Paypal password etc.

## What are they after?

their goal is to get hold your sensitive information which can lead to exploitation of your finances and and personal information. Ususally your bank accounts are at risk during a phishing attack.

## How do they do it?

Phishers typically use emails, text messages, or fake websites to lure you in. This attack can come in 2 types, active and passive:

- **Active** ðŸ‘‰ Where the phishers will call on your number, or initiate a voice call on any other platforms such as Whatsapp or Telegram, where they will try to be in constant communication with you untill you reveal some sensitive information.
- **Passive** ðŸ‘‰ Where phishers will drop you an email or a text message and prompt you to contact them immediately. Which will result in this attack being turned into an active attack. They might even setup a website which would look like it is legit, but it would not be, but you can end up going there even though your Google search results.

### Some common phishing scenarios

- They will send you an email that looks like it's from your bank, asking you to verify your account information. Where they might ask you to visit a suspicious link where (as per their requirements) you would need to login.
- They will contact you as a trusted company official or a government official, and ask you create an account on a shady website using the same email and password you use in your current bank or email account.
- They will send a text message claiming you've won a prize, but you need to click a link to claim it.
- They will create a fake website that looks identical to a popular website, like a social media platform or online shopping site.
- They will try to force you into buying something by making online payments.

**Note:** all of these scenarios lead to the same conclusion i.e. you can often end up with you typing your password in some shady website (if not telling them straight up) or tapping 'yes' when your email vendor asks you if you are trying to log into your account or not.

### Some common phishing tactics

- **Urgency** ðŸ‘‰ Whether you are on a phone call with them or communicating through text, they will create a sense of urgency and presurize you into sharing personal information.
- **Multiple Calls** ðŸ‘‰ They will often act in a team to contact you one after the other, making it look like they are trying to help you by redirecting you to their security engineer or someone on similar technical position.
- **Remote Control** ðŸ‘‰ They will ask you to install a remote-control software (such as AnyDesk) which lets anyone on the internet gain access to your computer and enable them to do any they want.
- **Convincing of Authority** ðŸ‘‰ They will go out of their way to convince you that they are talking on behalf of government or some popular company.

## What do they do after a successful phishing attack?

- They can steal money from your bank account and transfer it to their own without your consent.
- They can open new credit cards or loans in your name.
- They can sell your personal information on dark web.
- They can lock away your data and threaten to release sensitive information unless you pay a ransom.
