# HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are two important protocols used for transferring data over the web. The primary difference between them is the level of security they provide.

## Security

- **HTTP**: Data transferred over HTTP is not encrypted, which means that any data sent between the user and the server can potentially be intercepted and read by third parties.

- **HTTPS**: HTTPS uses encryption to secure the data transmitted between the user and the server. It encrypts the connection using a protocol such as TLS (Transport Layer Security), making it difficult for attackers to intercept or tamper with the data.

## Data Integrity

- **HTTP**: There is no guarantee that data sent over HTTP has not been altered during transmission.

- **HTTPS**: Ensures data integrity, meaning that the data cannot be modified or corrupted during transfer without detection.

## Conclusion

In summary, HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, providing encryption and data integrity, which are critical for protecting sensitive data and ensuring secure communication over the internet. As a result, HTTPS is strongly recommended for all websites, especially those that handle sensitive information.
