# Shoulder Surfing

Shoulder Surfing is a social engineering technique where an attacker observes a victim's actions to steal sensitive information, such as passwords, PINs, or other confidential data. This method typically involves directly looking over someone's shoulder as they enter information into a device, but it can also include the use of cameras or other recording devices to capture the information.
