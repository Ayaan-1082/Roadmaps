# Public vs Private IP addresses

Public and private IP addresses are two types of IP addresses used in computer networking.

A public IP address is an IP address that is assigned to a device by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and can be accessed over the public internet. This address is unique and globally routable, meaning that any device on the internet can communicate with it. Public IP addresses are used to identify devices such as web servers, email servers, and other devices that need to be accessed over the internet.

A private IP address is an IP address that is used within a local network and is not accessible from the public internet. Private IP addresses are used to identify devices on a local network, such as computers, printers, and other devices. These addresses are typically assigned by a router or other network device and are not unique globally. Private IP addresses are reserved for use in local networks and cannot be used on the public internet.

### Private Address Ranges

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned several address ranges to be used by private networks.

Address ranges to be use by private networks are:
	• Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
	• Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
	• Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

### Public Address Ranges
All addresses outside private IP address ranges are considered public. Public IP addresses are significantly more common than private IP addresses, and the public IP address ranges are:

• Class A: 1.0.0.0 – 9.255.255.255
• Class A: 11.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255
• Class B: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255
• Class C: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255
• Class E: 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 (reserved for future use)
