# Pointer

In Go, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers enable indirect referencing, allowing for the manipulation of data indirectly through the memory address it points to. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to pass a reference to a variable rather than its value, minimizing memory usage and facilitating efficient data manipulation. Go supports pointer arithmetic, but it restricts direct memory manipulation, enhancing safety. Pointers are often employed in functions to modify variables outside their scope, and their use can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary data copying. While pointers offer flexibility and efficiency, they should be used with care to prevent unintended side effects and ensure code readability.
