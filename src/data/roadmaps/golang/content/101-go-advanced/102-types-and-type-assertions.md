# Types, Type assertions and Type switches

**Types** in Golang specify the data type that a valid Go variable can hold. Golang has four categories of Types including Basic, Aggregate, Reference, and Interface Types

**Type assertions** in Go are a way to retrieve the dynamic value and the concrete type of an interface variable.

**Type switches** let you compare an interface variable’s type against several types. It’s similar to a regular switch statement, but focuses on types.
