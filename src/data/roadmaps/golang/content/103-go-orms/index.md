# ORMs

**Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a programming technique that bridges the gap between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases, enabling the conversion of data between them. In Go, two popular ORM libraries are GORM and Bun.

- **GORM**: GORM is a widely used ORM library in Go, offering comprehensive features and capabilities for seamless integration with relational databases. You can learn more about GORM from its [official website](https://gorm.io/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm).

- **Bun**: Bun is another powerful ORM library for Go, providing efficient database operations and a developer-friendly syntax. You can explore Bun's features and documentation on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/uptrace/bun).

By utilizing ORM libraries like GORM and Bun, you can simplify your database interactions and leverage the benefits of object-oriented programming in your Go applications.
