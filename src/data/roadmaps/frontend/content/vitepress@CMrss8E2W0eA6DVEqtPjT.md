# VitePress

VitePress is a Static Site Generator (SSG) designed for building fast, content-centric websites. In a nutshell, VitePress takes your source content written in Markdown, applies a theme to it, and generates static HTML pages that can be easily deployed anywhere.

VitePress aims to provide a great Developer Experience (DX) when working with Markdown content.
- Vite-Powered: instant server start, with edits always instantly reflected (<100ms) without page reload.
- Built-in Markdown Extensions: Frontmatter, tables, syntax highlighting... you name it. Specifically, VitePress provides many advanced features for working with code blocks, making it ideal for highly technical documentation.
- Vue-Enhanced Markdown: each Markdown page is also a Vue Single-File Component, thanks to Vue template's 100% syntax compatibility with HTML. You can embed interactivity in your static content using Vue templating features or imported Vue components.
