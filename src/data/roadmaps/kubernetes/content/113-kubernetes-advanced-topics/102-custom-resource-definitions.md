# Custom resource definitions
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are a powerful feature of Kubernetes that allow users to define their own custom resources and extend the Kubernetes API. With CRDs, users can define new resources that are specific to their applications and workloads, and use the same Kubernetes API to manage them.

To create a new custom resource, users define a CRD that specifies the structure and behavior of the resource. The CRD includes metadata such as the name and version of the resource, as well as a schema that describes the structure of the resource's data.

Once the CRD is defined, users can create instances of the custom resource, which can be managed using the Kubernetes API just like any other Kubernetes resource. The instances of the custom resource can be created, updated, and deleted using the same Kubernetes API operations as standard resources like pods or services.

Custom resources can be used to represent any type of data or state that is relevant to an application or workload, such as configuration settings, application-specific metadata, or status information. CRDs can be used to define resources for both stateful and stateless applications.

Custom resources can be managed using tools like kubectl, and can be integrated with other Kubernetes features like RBAC, networking, and storage.

Overall, CRDs provide a powerful way to extend the Kubernetes API and create custom resources that are tailored to the specific needs of an application or workload. By defining custom resources, users can leverage the full power of the Kubernetes API to manage their applications and infrastructure.
