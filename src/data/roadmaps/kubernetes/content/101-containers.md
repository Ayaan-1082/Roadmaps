# Containers

Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool. Container orchestration refers to the process of automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes provides a powerful set of tools and APIs for managing containers at scale, including:

* Container deployment: Kubernetes makes it easy to deploy containerized applications across a cluster of machines, ensuring that your application is highly available and resilient.

* Container scaling: Kubernetes can automatically scale your application up or down based on CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics.

* Container management: Kubernetes provides a powerful set of APIs for managing containers, including automatic restarts, rolling updates, and self-healing.

* Container networking: Kubernetes provides a flexible networking model for containers, allowing you to create and manage networks and services that can be accessed by other containers within the cluster.

* Container storage: Kubernetes provides built-in storage management for containers, allowing you to easily provision and manage persistent storage for your applications.

Overall, Kubernetes provides a comprehensive platform for managing containerized applications at scale, making it easier for developers and operations teams to focus on building and delivering software applications, rather than managing the underlying infrastructure. So before learning Kubernetes you should be comfortable running and building containers from scratch.
