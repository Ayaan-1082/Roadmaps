# Gitops
GitOps is a popular methodology for managing Kubernetes infrastructure and application deployments. By using Git as the primary tool for managing Kubernetes manifests, teams can ensure that infrastructure and application configurations are version controlled, easily auditable, and automatically deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.

Here are the key components of a GitOps workflow with Kubernetes:

* Kubernetes manifests: Kubernetes manifests define the desired state of the cluster, including deployments, services, ingress, and other Kubernetes resources.

* Git repository: GitOps workflows rely on a Git repository as the single source of truth for Kubernetes configuration. This repository holds the Kubernetes manifests as code, and changes to this code trigger deployment pipelines.

* Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines: CI/CD pipelines automatically build, test, and deploy Kubernetes manifests to the cluster. Changes to the Git repository trigger these pipelines, which apply the new configuration to the Kubernetes cluster.

* GitOps operator: GitOps operators are Kubernetes controllers that watch the Git repository for changes to the Kubernetes manifests. When changes are detected, the operator automatically updates the Kubernetes cluster to match the desired state defined in the Git repository.

* Observability tools: Observability tools such as Prometheus and Grafana can provide visibility into the health and performance of the Kubernetes cluster and applications running in it.

Here are some benefits of using GitOps with Kubernetes:

* Standardized deployments: GitOps ensures that Kubernetes manifests are managed as code, providing a standardized approach to infrastructure and application deployments.

* Continuous delivery: GitOps enables continuous delivery, with changes automatically deployed to the Kubernetes cluster whenever there are updates to the Git repository.

* Version control: Kubernetes manifests are version controlled in Git, providing an audit trail of changes and the ability to roll back to previous versions.

* Automated rollback: In the event of a failed deployment, GitOps can automatically roll back to the previous version of the Kubernetes manifests.

* Increased collaboration: GitOps workflows encourage collaboration between developers and operations teams, with changes managed in the Git repository and deployed automatically to the Kubernetes cluster.

Overall, GitOps provides a powerful approach to managing Kubernetes infrastructure and application deployments, enabling organizations to deliver software more quickly and reliably.
