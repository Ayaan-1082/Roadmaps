# Config maps
A ConfigMap is a Kubernetes object that is used to store configuration data. The configuration data is stored in key-value pairs and can be used to configure a Kubernetes application. ConfigMaps can be used to store configuration data for different components of an application.

For example, if you have an application that uses a database, you can store the database configuration in a ConfigMap. This makes it easy to change the database configuration without changing the application code
