# Kubernetes overview

Kubernetes is a popular open-source container orchestration platform that helps manage and deploy containerized applications at scale. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Kubernetes provides a powerful set of features for managing containerized applications, including automatic scaling, load balancing, storage orchestration, and self-healing. It allows developers to abstract away the underlying infrastructure and focus on building and deploying applications.
