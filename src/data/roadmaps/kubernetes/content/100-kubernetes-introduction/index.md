# Kubernetes Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that is used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

With Kubernetes, developers can package their applications into containers, which are lightweight, portable, and can run anywhere. These containers are then deployed to a cluster of machines, and Kubernetes takes care of managing the containers, ensuring that they are running properly, and scaling them up or down as needed.

Kubernetes uses a declarative approach, where users specify the desired state of their application, and Kubernetes takes care of reconciling the actual state with the desired state. This means that developers can focus on building their applications, and let Kubernetes handle the infrastructure.

Kubernetes provides a rich set of features, including service discovery, load balancing, automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing. It also supports a wide range of deployment strategies, including canary deployments, blue-green deployments, and A/B testing.
