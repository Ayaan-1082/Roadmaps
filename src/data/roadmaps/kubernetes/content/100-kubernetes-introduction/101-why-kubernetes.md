# Why kubernetes

Kubernetes is needed because it helps to solve some of the challenges that arise when deploying and managing containerized applications at scale. Some of the key reasons why Kubernetes is necessary include:

- Container Orchestration: Kubernetes provides a platform for orchestrating containers, which means it helps manage the scheduling, deployment, and scaling of containerized applications across a distributed system of nodes. This can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially as the number of containers and nodes grows.
- Automation: Kubernetes automates many of the tasks involved in deploying and managing containerized applications. For example, it can automatically scale applications based on resource usage or deploy new versions of applications without downtime.
- Portability: Kubernetes provides a consistent API for managing containers, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This means applications can be easily moved between different cloud providers or on-premise environments, without requiring significant changes to the deployment process.
- Self-Healing: Kubernetes is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. It can automatically detect and recover from failures, ensuring that applications remain available and responsive.
- Extensibility: Kubernetes is highly extensible and can be customized to meet the needs of different applications and deployment scenarios. This includes support for custom plugins and extensions, as well as integration with other cloud-native technologies.
