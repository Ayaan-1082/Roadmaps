# Why kubernetes

Kubernetes is a popular choice for container orchestration because it provides a powerful set of features for managing and deploying containerized applications at scale. Here are some reasons why Kubernetes is a popular choice:

Scalability: Kubernetes allows developers to easily scale their applications up or down as needed, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Fault tolerance: Kubernetes provides built-in fault tolerance features that help ensure that applications are highly available and reliable.

Flexibility: Kubernetes supports a wide range of container runtimes and cloud providers, giving developers the flexibility to choose the tools and platforms that work best for their needs.

Community: Kubernetes has a large and active community of contributors, making it easier to find support, share knowledge, and stay up-to-date on the latest developments.
