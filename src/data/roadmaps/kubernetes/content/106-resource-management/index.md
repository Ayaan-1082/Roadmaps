# Resource management
Kubernetes resource management involves managing the resources that are required by applications running in a Kubernetes cluster. These resources include CPU, memory, and storage.

Kubernetes provides several mechanisms for managing resources, including resource requests and limits, horizontal pod autoscaling, and vertical pod autoscaling.

## Resource Requests and Limits

Resource requests and limits are used to define the amount of resources that are required by a container running in a Kubernetes pod. Resource requests are the minimum amount of resources that are required by a container, while resource limits are the maximum amount of resources that a container can consume.

These settings can be specified in the pod's YAML file, and Kubernetes will schedule the pod to a node that has enough resources available to satisfy the pod's requirements.

## Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) is used to automatically scale the number of replicas of a pod based on resource utilization. HPA monitors the resource utilization of the pod and adjusts the number of replicas as necessary to maintain the desired resource utilization.

For example, if the CPU utilization of a pod is consistently high, HPA will automatically increase the number of replicas to handle the increased load. Similarly, if the CPU utilization is consistently low, HPA will reduce the number of replicas to conserve resources.

## Vertical Pod Autoscaling

Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA) is used to automatically adjust the resource limits of a pod based on its resource utilization. VPA monitors the resource utilization of the pod and adjusts the resource limits as necessary to maintain the desired resource utilization.

For example, if the CPU utilization of a pod is consistently high, VPA will increase the CPU limit of the pod to handle the increased load. Similarly, if the CPU utilization is consistently low, VPA will reduce the CPU limit to conserve resources.

In conclusion, Kubernetes provides several mechanisms for managing resources in a Kubernetes cluster. These mechanisms allow you to ensure that your applications have the resources they need to run efficiently while minimizing resource waste.
