# Network security
Kubernetes provides several network security features that you can use to secure your containerized applications running in Kubernetes. Here are some of the key network security features of Kubernetes:

* Network policies: Network policies allow you to control network traffic between pods and namespaces in your Kubernetes cluster. With network policies, you can define ingress and egress rules to allow or block traffic based on specific criteria, such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

* Pod-to-pod encryption: By default, Kubernetes uses unencrypted communication between pods. However, you can enable pod-to-pod encryption by using TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt traffic between pods. This ensures that traffic is encrypted in transit and protected from eavesdropping and tampering.

* Secure communication with Kubernetes API server: You can use TLS to secure communication between Kubernetes components and external clients, such as the Kubernetes API server. This ensures that sensitive data, such as authentication tokens and configuration information, is encrypted in transit and protected from unauthorized access.

* Authentication and authorization: Kubernetes provides several mechanisms for authentication and authorization, including client certificates, bearer tokens, and role-based access control (RBAC). These mechanisms ensure that only authorized users can access Kubernetes resources and perform specific actions.

* Service mesh: Kubernetes provides integration with service mesh technologies like Istio, which provides additional network security features like mutual TLS authentication and fine-grained access control for network traffic between services.

By using these network security features, you can ensure that your containerized applications running in Kubernetes are secure and protected from unauthorized access and network-based attacks.
