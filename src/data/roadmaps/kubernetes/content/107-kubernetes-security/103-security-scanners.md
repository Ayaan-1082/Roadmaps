# Security scanners
Security scanners are tools that help to identify potential security vulnerabilities and threats in your Kubernetes environment. There are several security scanners available that are specifically designed for Kubernetes, including:

* Kubernetes Vulnerability Scanners: These tools scan Kubernetes clusters for vulnerabilities in the system and provide reports of the issues found. Examples of Kubernetes vulnerability scanners include Aqua Security, Sysdig Secure, and Twistlock.

* Kubernetes Configuration Scanners: These tools scan Kubernetes configurations to identify potential security issues in the deployment, service, or pod definition. Examples of Kubernetes configuration scanners include Kube-Bench and Kube-hunter.

* Kubernetes Compliance Scanners: These tools ensure that your Kubernetes environment is compliant with industry and regulatory standards. Examples of Kubernetes compliance scanners include Kubernetes Policy Controller and Open Policy Agent (OPA).

* Kubernetes Image Scanners: These tools scan container images for known vulnerabilities and risks. Examples of Kubernetes image scanners include Anchore and Clair.

By using these security scanners, you can proactively identify and address potential security issues in your Kubernetes environment, and ensure that your applications and data are protected from unauthorized access and attacks.
