# SCRUM

SCRUM is an agile framework designed to help teams work together more effectively, particularly in software development. It focuses on iterative progress, where work is completed in small, time-boxed iterations known as sprints. Each sprint typically lasts between two to four weeks and includes activities like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

The Scrum framework is built around key roles: the **Product Owner**, who is responsible for managing the product backlog and ensuring that the team is working on the most valuable tasks; the **Scrum Master**, who facilitates the Scrum process and helps the team improve continuously; and the **Development Team**, which is responsible for delivering the product increment at the end of each sprint.

Scrum emphasizes transparency, inspection, and adaptation, allowing teams to quickly respond to changing requirements and continuously improve their processes and the product itself. This flexibility and focus on continuous improvement are what make Scrum so effective in managing complex projects.
