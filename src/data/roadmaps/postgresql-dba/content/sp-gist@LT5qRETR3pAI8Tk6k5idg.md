# Using SP-GiST Indexes in PostgreSQL

Spatial Generalized Search Tree (SP-GiST) is a versatile index type offered by PostgreSQL. It is designed for complex, non-rectangular data types and works especially well with geometrical and network-based data. It's a reliable choice for applications dealing with geometrical, network-based, or other irregular data distributions. However, keep in mind the index creation time and size when choosing SP-GiST, and always test its performance with your specific data and use case.
