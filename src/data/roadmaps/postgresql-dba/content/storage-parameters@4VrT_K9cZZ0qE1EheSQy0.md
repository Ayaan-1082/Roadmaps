# Storage Parameters in PostgreSQL

Storage parameters help optimize the database's performance by allowing you to configure settings related to memory usage, storage behavior, and buffer management for specific tables and indexes. PostgreSQL provides several configuration options to tailor the behavior of storage and I/O on a per-table or per-index basis. These options are set using the `ALTER TABLE` or `ALTER INDEX` commands, and they affect the overall performance of your database.
