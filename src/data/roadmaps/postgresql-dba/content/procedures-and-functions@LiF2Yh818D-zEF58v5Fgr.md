# Procedures and Functions in PostgreSQL

In PostgreSQL, functions and procedures encapsulate reusable logic within the database to enhance performance and maintain organization. Functions return a value or a table, take input parameters, and are used in SQL queries, defined with `CREATE FUNCTION`. Procedures, introduced in PostgreSQL 11, do not return values but can perform actions and include transaction control commands like `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`, defined with `CREATE PROCEDURE` and called using the `CALL` statement. Key differences include functions' mandatory return value and integration in SQL queries, while procedures focus on performing operations and managing transactions.
