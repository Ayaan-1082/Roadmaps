# Transactions

Transactions are a fundamental concept in PostgreSQL, as well as in most other database management systems. A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. Transactions help ensure that the database remains in a consistent state even when there are multiple users or operations occurring concurrently.
