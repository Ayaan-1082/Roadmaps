# Write Ahead Log

The Write Ahead Log, also known as the WAL, is a crucial part of PostgreSQL's data consistency strategy. The WAL records all changes made to the database in a sequential log before they are written to the actual data files. In case of a crash, PostgreSQL can use the WAL to bring the database back to a consistent state without losing any crucial data. This provides durability and crash recovery capabilities for your database.
