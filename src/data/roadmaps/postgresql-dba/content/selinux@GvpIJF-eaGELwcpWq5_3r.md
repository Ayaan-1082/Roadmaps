# SELinux

SELinux, or Security-Enhanced Linux, is a Linux kernel security module that brings heightened access control and security policies to your system. It is specifically designed to protect your system from unauthorized access and data leaks by enforcing a strict security policy, preventing processes from accessing resources they shouldn't, which is a significant tool for database administrators to help secure PostgreSQL instances.
