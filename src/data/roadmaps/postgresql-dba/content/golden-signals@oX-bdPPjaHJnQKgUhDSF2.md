# Golden Signals

Golden Signals are a set of metrics that help monitor application performance and health, particularly in distributed systems. These metrics are derived from Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices and can be easily applied to PostgreSQL troubleshooting methods. By monitoring these four key signals – latency, traffic, errors, and saturation – you can gain a better understanding of your PostgreSQL database's overall performance and health, as well as quickly identify potential issues.
