# Physical Storage and File Layout

PostgreSQL's physical storage and file layout optimize data management and performance through a structured organization within the data directory, which includes subdirectories like `base` for individual databases, `global` for cluster-wide tables, `pg_wal` for Write-Ahead Logs ensuring durability, and `pg_tblspc` for tablespaces allowing flexible storage management. Key configuration files like `postgresql.conf`, `pg_hba.conf`, and `pg_ident.conf` are also located here. This layout facilitates efficient data handling, recovery, and maintenance, ensuring robust database operations.
