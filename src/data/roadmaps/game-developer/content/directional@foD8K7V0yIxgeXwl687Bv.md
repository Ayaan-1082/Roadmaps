# Directional Lights

Directional lights are one of the most basic tools for computer graphics and game development, as they simulate the behavior of sunlight. 

Most commonly, they emit parallel rays to provide uniform lighting over an entire scene, making them ideal for outdoor use. 

Most game engines, such as Unity and Unreal, come by default with templates that already include directional lights; thus, developers can easily provide real-life-like lighting within their scenes without much hassle.

These lights have a number of parameters that are adjustable: intensity, color, volumetric scattering, and shadows. With the settings, developers have fine control over how much effect the light would have in the scene for different times of day, mood, and atmospheric effect. 

Directional lights also cast shadows very realistically, which adds depth and realism into scenes. These kinds of directional lights, even if powerful, are usually performance-intensive, especially in combination with dynamic shadows and volumetric effects.
