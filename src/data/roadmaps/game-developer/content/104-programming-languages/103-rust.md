# Rust

**Rust** is a modern, open-source, multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. It was initially designed by Mozilla Research as a language that can provide memory safety without garbage collection. Since then, it has gained popularity due to its features and performance that often compare favorably to languages like C++. Its rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety while maintaining a high level of abstraction. Rust supports a mixture of imperative procedural, concurrent actor, object-oriented and pure functional styles.
