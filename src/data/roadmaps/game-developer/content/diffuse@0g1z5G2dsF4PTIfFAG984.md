# Diffuse

When a ray of light strikes a surface, if the angle at which it makes contact with the surface is not the same as the angle of the layer leaving after being reflected, that would be an example of a `diffuse` reflection. So, when you shine a light on an object and there is no mirror-like reflection, that is a diffuse reflection.
