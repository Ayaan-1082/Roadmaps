# Polygons

Polygons in games and computer graphics are the most basic building blocks of the 3D objects we see in a scene, often referred to as meshes. The number of polygons in a mesh determines the level of detail and quality of that mesh, but it also directly impacts performance. Low-detail meshes, commonly known as low-poly, are often used to optimize performance. In some games, this low-poly aesthetic becomes a defining aspect of the game's art style, as seen in titles like Firewatch, Superhot, and Astroneer.

Polygons are a fundamental aspect of games and computer graphics. These simple geometric shapes can be processed concurrently by the GPU, making them ideal for real-time rendering. The process of rasterization, which converts 3D objects and meshes into a 2D image on the screen, works most efficiently with polygons. 

Triangles are especially favored because any 3D shape can be broken down into triangles, making them the fundamental unit in 3D graphics. This simplicity, combined with their computational efficiency, has made polygons the industry standard in game development and computer graphics.
