# Primitive Types

In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties and are not mutable in nature. There are 7 primitive data types:

- `string`
- `number`
- `bigint`
- `boolean`
- `undefined`
- `Symbol`
- `null`

#### String :
A String is a sequence of characters. In Javascript, a String is one of the primitive values and the String object is a wrapper around a String primitive.
#### Number :
In JavaScript, Number is a numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating point format (IEEE 754). All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).
#### BigInt :
In JavaScript, BigInt is a numeric data type that can represent integers in an arbitrary precision format, indicates that calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are limited only  by the available memory of the host system.
#### Boolean :
A Boolean is a logical data type that can have only the values true or false. In JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in if statements) or repeat (such as in for loops).
#### Undefined :
undefined is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared, or to formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.
#### Symbol :
A symbol is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol primitive — also called a Symbol value or just a Symbol — that's guaranteed to be unique. Symbols are often used to add unique property keys to an object that won't collide with keys any other code might add to the object, and which are hidden from any mechanisms other code will typically use to access the object. That enables a form of weak encapsulation or a weak form of information hiding.
#### Null :
In JavaScript, null is marked as one of the primitive values, because its behavior is seemingly primitive. However, when using the typeof operator, it returns "object". A null value represents a reference that points, generally intentionally, to a nonexistent or invalid object or address.



Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.
