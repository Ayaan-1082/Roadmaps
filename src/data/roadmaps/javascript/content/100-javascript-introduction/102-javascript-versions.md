# Javascript Versions

JavaScript, invented by Brendan Eich, achieved the status of an ECMA standard in 1997 and adopted the official name ECMAScript. This language has evolved through several versions, namely ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and the transformative ES6. These iterations mark significant milestones in enhancing and standardizing JavaScript's capabilities, contributing to its widespread adoption and utility in the ever-evolving landscape of web development.
