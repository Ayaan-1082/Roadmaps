# Solana

Solana is a public blockchain platform with smart contract functionality. Its native cryptocurrency is SOL. Solana offers low transaction fees and high throughput with 400ms confirmation time for each block. Solana is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain but improves on it with a mechanism called proof-of-history (PoH), which uses hashed timestamps to verify when transactions occur. Solanaâ€™s combination of high throughput, low costs, innovative consensus mechanism, and robust developer support makes it a compelling choice for a wide range of blockchain applications.
