# Oracle Networks

By leveraging many different data sources, and implementing an oracle system that isn’t controlled by a single entity, decentralized oracle networks provide an increased level of security and fairness to smart contracts.

Off chain calculation can lift some of the computational weight from price feed oracles, however optimistic oracles can remove the need for a feed altogether.  Based on Schelling point theory, they use cryptoeconomic guarentees embedded in smart contracts to ensure the accuracy and security of the data, allowing for greater efficiency and more efficient use of resources. One such oracle, [UMA protocol](https://uma.xyz/) provides template smart contracts for a range of purposes, which are available on [Cookbook](https://www.cookbook.dev/).
