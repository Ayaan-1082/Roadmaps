# Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

* React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
* With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

There are a couple of ways that developers can create functions that help handle events in a react
application. However, its important to keep in mind that we should create event handlers in such a way that
it promotes code readability and maintenance.
