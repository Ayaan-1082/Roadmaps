# Test Oracles

A test oracle is a mechanism; different from the program itself that can be used to check the correctness of the program's output for the test cases. Conceptually, we can consider testing a process in which the test cases are given to the test oracle and the program under testing.

Testing oracles are required for testing. Ideally, we want an automated oracle, which always gives the correct answer. However, often oracles are human beings, who mostly calculate by hand what the output of the program should be. As it is often very difficult to determine whether the behavior corresponds to the expected behavior, our “human deities” may make mistakes. Consequently, when there is a discrepancy, between the program and the result, we must verify the result produced by the oracle before declaring that there is a defect in the result.
