# Github actions
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool that helps you build, test, and deploy your changes on production directly from your repository. You can use it to set up app releases on certain events like committing a tag in a certain branch of your repository.Additionally, one doesnâ€™t have to create a workflow for common things across the projects as GitHub has a marketplace from which you can use existing workflows developed by others.
