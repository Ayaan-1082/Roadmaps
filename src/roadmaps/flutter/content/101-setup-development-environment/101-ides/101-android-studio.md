# Android studio

Android Studio is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems.

Updating the plugins

Updates to the plugins are shipped on a regular basis. You should be prompted in the IDE when an update is available.

To check for updates manually:

- Open preferences (`Android Studio` > `Check for Updates on macOS`, `Help` > `Check for Updates` on Linux).
- If `dart` or `flutter` are listed, update them.
