# Rxdart

RxDart is an implementation of the popular [**reactiveX**](https://reactivex.io/) api for asynchronous programming, leveraging the native Dart Streams api. It extends the capabilities of Dart Streams and StreamControllers.<br><br>
RxDart adds functionality to Dart Streams in three ways:
- Stream Classes - create Streams with specific capabilities, such as combining or merging many Streams.
- Extension Methods - transform a source Stream into a new Stream with different capabilities, such as throttling or buffering events.
- Subjects - StreamControllers with additional powers
