# Variables

Here’s an example of creating a variable and initializing it:

`var name = 'Bob';`

Variables store references. The variable called `name` contains a reference to a `String` object with a value of “Bob”.

The type of the `name` variable is inferred to be `String`, but you can change that type by specifying it. If an object isn’t restricted to a single type, specify the `Object` type (or `dynamic` if necessary).

`Object name = 'Bob';`

Another option is to explicitly declare the type that would be inferred:

`String name = 'Bob';`
