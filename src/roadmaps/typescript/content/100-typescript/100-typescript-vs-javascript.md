# TypeScript vs JavaScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations and other features such as interfaces, classes, and namespaces. JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language that is primarily used for client-side web development and can also be used for server-side development.

Here are a few key differences between TypeScript and JavaScript:

- **Types**: TypeScript has optional type annotations while JavaScript is dynamically-typed. This means that in TypeScript, you can specify the data type of variables, parameters, and return values, which can help catch type-related errors at compile-time.
- **Syntax**: TypeScript extends JavaScript syntax with features like interfaces, classes, and namespaces. This provides a more robust and organized structure for large-scale projects.
- **Tooling**: TypeScript has better tooling support, such as better editor integration, type checking, and code refactoring.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: TypeScript is fully compatible with existing JavaScript code, which means you can use TypeScript in any JavaScript environment.
- One of the main advantages of TypeScript over JavaScript is that it provides a more robust type system that allows for better code documentation, error detection, and code maintenance. TypeScript also has better support for modern ECMAScript features and provides better tooling for large-scale projects.
