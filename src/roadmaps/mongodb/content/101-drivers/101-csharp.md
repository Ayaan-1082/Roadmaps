# MongoDB C# Analyzer (Visual Studio IDE Extension)
This is a Roslyn Analyzer offered by MongoDB that helps you understand the following about your MongoDB .NET driver code:

- How your code translates into the MongoDB Query API
- If your code includes unsupported LINQ or builder expressions

It integrates into Visual Studio IDE.
