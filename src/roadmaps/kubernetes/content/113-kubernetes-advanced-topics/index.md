# Kubernetes advanced topics
Here are some advanced topics in Kubernetes along with examples:

Service Mesh: A service mesh is a layer of infrastructure that provides network-level services such as traffic routing, load balancing, and security for microservices. Examples of popular service mesh implementations include Istio and Linkerd.

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): CRDs are used to extend the Kubernetes API by defining custom resources that can be managed by Kubernetes controllers. An example of a CRD is the Istio VirtualService, which defines routing rules for a service mesh.

Operators: Operators are Kubernetes controllers that can be used to automate the management of complex applications or services. An example of an operator is the Prometheus Operator, which automates the deployment and management of Prometheus monitoring instances.

Kubernetes-native storage: Kubernetes-native storage provides a way to manage persistent storage for containerized applications within the Kubernetes cluster. Examples of Kubernetes-native storage include Storage Classes, Persistent Volumes, and Persistent Volume Claims.

Multi-tenancy: Multi-tenancy refers to the ability to run multiple applications or tenants on a shared Kubernetes cluster while ensuring isolation and security between tenants. Examples of tools for achieving multi-tenancy in Kubernetes include Namespaces, Network Policies, and Pod Security Policies.

Hybrid cloud deployments: Kubernetes can be used to deploy and manage applications across multiple cloud providers or on-premises data centers. Examples of tools for hybrid cloud deployments include Kubernetes Federation, which allows for the management of multiple Kubernetes clusters, and the Kubernetes API Server, which can be used to connect Kubernetes clusters across different environments.

Observability: Observability refers to the ability to monitor and debug applications running in a Kubernetes cluster. Examples of observability tools for Kubernetes include Prometheus, Grafana, and Fluentd.

These are just a few examples of advanced topics in Kubernetes. As Kubernetes continues to evolve and mature, new features and capabilities will emerge, enabling more complex and sophisticated deployment and management scenarios.
