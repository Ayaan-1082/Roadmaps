# Metrics
Kubernetes provides a wide range of metrics that can be used to monitor and optimize the performance of your Kubernetes environment. Here are some important Kubernetes metrics to monitor:

* CPU and Memory Usage: Monitor CPU and memory usage of your Kubernetes pods to ensure that they are running optimally. You can use metrics such as CPU usage percentage, memory usage percentage, and memory usage in bytes to track this.

* Network Usage: Monitor network usage of your Kubernetes pods to ensure that they are communicating effectively with each other and with external systems. You can use metrics such as bytes sent and received, and network errors to track this.

* Disk Usage: Monitor disk usage of your Kubernetes pods to ensure that they have enough space to store data. You can use metrics such as disk usage percentage and disk usage in bytes to track this.

* API Server Metrics: Monitor the Kubernetes API server metrics to ensure that it is running optimally. You can use metrics such as API request rate, API request latency, and API response codes to track this.

* Cluster-level Metrics: Monitor cluster-level metrics such as the number of nodes in the cluster, the number of pods in the cluster, and the cluster-wide CPU and memory usage to ensure that the cluster is healthy and performing well.

* Application-level Metrics: Monitor application-level metrics such as the number of requests per second, the average response time, and the error rate to ensure that your applications are running optimally.

Kubernetes provides several built-in monitoring tools, including kube-state-metrics and Prometheus, that can be used to collect and analyze these metrics. You can also use third-party monitoring solutions such as Datadog, New Relic, and Sysdig to monitor your Kubernetes environment. By monitoring these metrics, you can proactively identify and address issues in your Kubernetes environment and optimize the performance of your applications.
