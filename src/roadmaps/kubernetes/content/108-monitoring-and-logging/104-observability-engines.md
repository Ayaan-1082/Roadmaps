# Observability engines
Observability engines in Kubernetes are tools that provide visibility and insights into the behavior and performance of your Kubernetes environment. These tools collect data from various sources, such as logs, metrics, and traces, and provide a unified view of your environment, making it easier to diagnose issues and optimize performance.

Here are some popular observability engines in Kubernetes:

* Prometheus: Prometheus is a popular open-source monitoring system that can be used to collect and analyze metrics in Kubernetes. Prometheus provides a flexible querying language and a user-friendly web interface for visualizing and analyzing metrics.

* Grafana: Grafana is a popular open-source platform for data visualization and analytics. Grafana can be used with Prometheus to create custom dashboards for visualizing metrics in Kubernetes.

* Jaeger: Jaeger is an open-source distributed tracing tool that can be used to collect and analyze traces in Kubernetes. Jaeger provides a rich set of features, including trace visualization, service dependency analysis, and anomaly detection.

* Fluentd: Fluentd is a popular open-source log collector that can be used to collect and analyze logs in Kubernetes. Fluentd provides a unified logging layer for your Kubernetes environment, making it easier to manage and analyze logs.

* Elastic Stack: The Elastic Stack, also known as ELK Stack, is a popular open-source platform for collecting, indexing, and analyzing logs in Kubernetes. The Elastic Stack includes Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, which can be used together to create custom dashboards and visualizations for your Kubernetes logs.

By using observability engines in Kubernetes, you can gain deep insights into the behavior and performance of your applications, diagnose issues more quickly, and optimize the performance of your microservices.
