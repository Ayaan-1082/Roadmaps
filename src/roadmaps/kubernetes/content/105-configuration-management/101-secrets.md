# Secrets
Secrets are used to store sensitive information in a Kubernetes cluster. This information includes passwords, API keys, and TLS certificates. Secrets are used to provide secure access to sensitive data in Kubernetes.

Secrets can be used to store sensitive data for different components of an application. For example, if you have an application that uses an API key, you can store the API key in a Secret. This makes it easy to manage the API key without exposing it to unauthorized users.

In conclusion, ConfigMaps and Secrets are important tools for managing Kubernetes applications. They allow you to store and manage configuration data and sensitive information in a secure manner.
