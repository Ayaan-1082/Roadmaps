# Kubernetes overview
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that helps in automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was initially developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes provides a scalable and flexible infrastructure for deploying and managing containerized applications, and it can be run on-premises or in the cloud.

Kubernetes operates using a master-slave architecture. The master node controls the cluster and its resources, while the worker nodes are responsible for running the containers and applications. Kubernetes uses a declarative configuration system to define the desired state of the cluster and automatically takes care of the necessary actions to achieve that state.

Kubernetes allows you to run containerized applications in a reliable and consistent way, providing features such as:

Scaling: Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of containers running based on resource usage.

Rolling updates: Kubernetes can deploy updates to your application without any downtime.

Load balancing: Kubernetes can distribute traffic across containers to ensure that your application is highly available.

Self-healing: Kubernetes can automatically restart containers that fail, and it can even replace failed nodes in the cluster.

Storage orchestration: Kubernetes can manage storage for your containers and provide features such as persistent volumes.

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration and is widely used in production environments. Its rich set of features and flexibility make it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from small-scale deployments to large-scale, distributed systems.
