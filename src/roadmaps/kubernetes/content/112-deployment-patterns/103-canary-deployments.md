# Canary deployments
Canary deployments are a deployment pattern used in modern software development and deployment that allows for the gradual rollout of new application versions to a subset of users or servers to reduce the risk of errors or downtime in production environments.

In a canary deployment, a new version of an application is deployed to a small subset of users or servers, while the remaining users or servers continue to use the old version. The traffic is gradually shifted from the old version to the new version, allowing the new version to be tested in a real-world environment with minimal risk.

Here are some key components of a canary deployment:

* Baseline version: The existing version of the application that is currently running in production.

* Canary version: The new version of the application that is being tested in production with a small subset of users or servers.

* Traffic routing: The process of routing a portion of the traffic to the canary version while the majority of the traffic continues to be served by the baseline version.

* Monitoring and testing: The process of monitoring the canary version for errors or issues and conducting testing to ensure it is performing as expected.

* Rollback plan: A plan for quickly rolling back to the baseline version if issues arise with the canary version.

Here are some benefits of using canary deployments:

* Reduced risk: Canary deployments allow for new application versions to be tested in a real-world environment with minimal risk to the entire production environment.

* Faster deployment: Canary deployments allow for faster deployment of new application versions as they can be gradually rolled out and tested.

* Improved reliability: Canary deployments help improve the reliability of applications by catching errors or issues before they affect the entire production environment.

* Improved user experience: Canary deployments can help improve the user experience by allowing new features to be tested with a small subset of users before being rolled out to the entire user base.

Overall, canary deployments are a valuable deployment pattern for modern software development and deployment that can help reduce risk, improve reliability, and speed up the deployment process.
