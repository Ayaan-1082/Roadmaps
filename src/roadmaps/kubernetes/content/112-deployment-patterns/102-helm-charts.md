# Helm charts
Helm charts are a way of packaging and deploying Kubernetes applications. They provide a convenient way to package and share applications, manage dependencies, and deploy applications consistently across multiple environments.

Here are some key components of a Helm chart:

* Chart.yaml: This file provides metadata about the chart, such as the name, version, and description.

* Templates: The templates directory contains Kubernetes manifest files that define the application and its dependencies.

* Values.yaml: This file contains default configuration values for the application, which can be overridden during installation.

* Helpers: The helpers directory contains reusable code snippets that can be used in the templates.

* Hooks: Hooks are scripts that run during chart installation or deletion, allowing you to perform custom actions such as running database migrations.

Here are some benefits of using Helm charts:

* Simplified deployment: Helm charts simplify the deployment of Kubernetes applications by packaging all the necessary configuration files and dependencies into a single chart.

* Reusability: Helm charts can be shared and reused, allowing developers to quickly and easily deploy complex applications.

* Consistency: Helm charts ensure that applications are deployed consistently across multiple environments, reducing the risk of configuration errors.

* Configuration management: Helm charts make it easy to manage application configuration, with default values that can be overridden during installation.

* Version control: Helm charts can be version controlled in Git, providing an audit trail of changes and the ability to roll back to previous versions.

Overall, Helm charts are a powerful tool for packaging and deploying Kubernetes applications, providing a standardized way to manage configuration and dependencies across multiple environments.
