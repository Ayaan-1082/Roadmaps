# Deployment patterns
Kubernetes deployment patterns refer to various strategies and techniques that can be used to deploy, manage, and scale applications in a Kubernetes cluster. Here are some common Kubernetes deployment patterns:

* Rolling update deployment: This deployment pattern involves updating one or more instances of an application at a time, without any downtime, by gradually replacing instances with updated ones. This pattern is ideal for non-critical updates and feature enhancements.

* Blue-green deployment: This deployment pattern involves having two identical environments, one representing the current production environment (blue), and the other representing the new version of the application (green). Traffic is initially routed to the green environment, and once it has been thoroughly tested, it is switched from the blue environment to the green environment.

* Canary deployment: This deployment pattern involves gradually rolling out new versions of the application to a subset of users or traffic, allowing for careful testing and monitoring of the new version before releasing it to all users.

* A/B testing: This deployment pattern involves deploying two different versions of the application to different subsets of users or traffic, allowing for comparison and analysis of the performance and user experience of each version.

* Stateful application deployment: This deployment pattern is used for applications that require persistent storage and can be scaled horizontally or vertically. Stateful application deployment patterns include StatefulSets, DaemonSets, and ReplicaSets.

* Serverless deployment: This deployment pattern involves deploying applications as serverless functions, allowing for automatic scaling and management of resources.

These deployment patterns are just some examples of the many strategies and techniques that can be used to deploy and manage applications in a Kubernetes cluster. The choice of deployment pattern will depend on the specific requirements and goals of the application being deployed.
