# Pod priorities
Pod priorities are a feature in Kubernetes that allow administrators to prioritize which pods should be scheduled first in case of resource constraints or node failures. Priorities are used by the Kubernetes scheduler to determine the order in which pods should be scheduled on available nodes.

Here's how pod priorities work:

* Define priority classes: Priority classes are used to define the relative priorities of pods. Each priority class has a unique name and a numeric value that determines its relative priority compared to other classes. Higher numeric values mean higher priority.

```
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: high-priority
value: 1000000
globalDefault: false
description: "This priority class should be used for high-priority pods."
```
In this example, a priority class named `high-priority` is defined with a value of `1000000`.

* Assign priority classes to pods: Once priority classes are defined, they can be assigned to pods using the `priorityClassName` field in the pod specification.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
  priorityClassName: high-priority
```
In this example, a pod named `my-pod` is defined with a container running the `nginx` image and assigned the `high-priority` priority class.

* Schedule pods based on priorities: When the Kubernetes scheduler assigns pods to nodes, it takes into account the priorities assigned to each pod. Pods with higher priority classes are scheduled before pods with lower priority classes. If multiple pods have the same priority class, the scheduler uses other criteria such as resource requirements and node affinity to determine the order of scheduling.

By using pod priorities, administrators can ensure that high-priority workloads are scheduled first in case of resource constraints or node failures, improving the reliability and availability of their applications.
