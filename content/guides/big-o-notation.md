Big-O notation is the mathematical notation that helps analyse the algorithms to get an idea about how they might perform as the input grows. The image below explains Big-O in a simple way without using any fancy terminology. 

Time Complexity - The time complexity of an algorithm specifies the total time taken by an algorithm to execute as a function of the inputâ€™s length.

Some Time Complexities:
->  Constant: O(1)
->  Linear time: O(n)
->  Logarithmic time: O(n log n)
->  Quadratic time: O(n^2)
->  Exponential time: 2 ^{polyn}
->  Factorial time: O(n!)
->  Polynomial-time: 2^{O(log n)}
