# Graph Data Structure

The grapg data structure is a non-linear data structure that comprises of vertices or nodes and edges (or lines or arcs). Vertices are nodes and the edges connect the vertices to each other accirdingly. A graph is denoted by G(E,V) where E standes for edges and V stands for vertices. Unlike tree, graphs can have more than two edges or lines or arcs that connect the vertices together.
