# Package Managers

Package managers allow you to manage the dependencies (external code written by you or someone else) that your project needs to work correctly.

## Honorable Mention
 - Poetry
   - https://python-poetry.org/
   - Manages dependancies via isolation
 - PIPX
   - https://github.com/pypa/pipx
   - Isolation based app deployment, so you don't have to affect system or user PIP libraries
   - Enables you to try individual python cli tools without affecting other dependancies.
