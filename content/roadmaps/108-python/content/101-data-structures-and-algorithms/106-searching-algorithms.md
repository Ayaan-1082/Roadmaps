# Searching Algorithms

The Main searching algorithms that we use in python are Linear Search and Binary Search.

## Linear Search

Linear search is one of the simplest searching algorithms, and the easiest to understand. We iterate over a data structure(i.e List in python) linearly and return
the index of the first occurrence of an item that we are looking for.
- The Time Complexity for searching an element using Linear search is O(n) where n is the size of the data structure (i.e list).
- The Space Complexity is O(1).

## Binary Search

Binary search follows a divide and conquer methodology. 
It is faster than linear search but requires that the array be sorted before the algorithm is executed.
- The Time Complexity for searching an element using Binary search is O(logn) where n is the size of the data structure (i.e list).
- The Space Complexity is O(1).
