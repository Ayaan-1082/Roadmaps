# Templates

In Angular, if you take any fragment of a user interface (UI), the template will acts like a blueprint .These Templates are written in HTML, and special syntax can be used within a template to build on many of Angular's features. Angular extends the HTML syntax in your templates with additional functionality.
For example, Angularâ€™s data binding syntax helps to set Document Object Model (DOM) properties dynamically.

Almost all HTML syntax is valid template syntax. However, because an Angular template is only a fragment of the UI, it does not include elements such as <html>, <body>, or <base>.
