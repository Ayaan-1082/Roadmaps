# What is typescript

- TypeScript is the primary language for developing Angular applications. It's a superset of JavaScript with type safety and design-time support for tools.

- Browsers cannot directly execute TypeScript. Typescript must be "transpiled" to JavaScript using the tsc compiler. This requires some configuration.
