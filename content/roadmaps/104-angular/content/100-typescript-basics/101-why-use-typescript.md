# Why use typescript

 
TypeScript  is the next generation of JavaScript with some amazing features:

- TypeScript code canâ€™t be natively interpreted by browsers. So if the code was written in TypeScript, it gets compiled and converted into JavaScript. This process is known as Trans-piled.

- Whatever code is written in JavaScript can be converted to TypeScript by changing the extension from .js to .ts.
Use TypeScript anywhere: TypeScript can be compiled to run on any browser, device, or operating system. TypeScript is not specific to any single environment.

- With TypeScript, developers can use already existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, or call the TS Code from native JavaScript code.
