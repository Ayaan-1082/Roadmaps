# Dependency injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that creates the dependencies of a class and provides those objects to the class when required. Angular being a nice framework provides a built-in dependency injection mechanism that creates and provides runtime version of a dependency value using dependency injectors.

In order for dependency injectors to provide values, we must first configure the injector which tells the injectors that which values to provide. Injectors configuration is done using providers.
