# Template Driven Forms

A Template driven form is the simplest form we can build in Angular. It is mainly used for creating simple form application. 

It uses two-way data-binding (ngModel) to create and handle the form components.

Template-driven forms rely on directives defined in the FormsModule.
NgModel: This feature enables you to respond to user input with authentication mechanism and error handling by balancing value changes in the associated form element with changes in the data model.
NgModelGroup: Creates and binds a FormGroup instance to a DOM element.
NgForm: In order to track aggregate form value and validation status, a top-level FormGroup instance is created and bound to a <form> element. This directive becomes active by default on all <form> tags as soon as FormsModule is imported. There is no need to include a unique selector.
