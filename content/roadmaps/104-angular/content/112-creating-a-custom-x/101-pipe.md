# Pipe
 Pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display. Pipes are simple functions to use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value. Pipes are useful because you can use them throughout your application, while only declaring each pipe once. For example, you would use a pipe to show a date as April 15, 1988 rather than the raw string format.

 # Custom Pipe
 Create custom pipes to encapsulate transformations that are not provided with the built-in pipes. Then, use your custom pipe in template expressions, the same way you use built-in pipesâ€”to transform input values to output values for display.
