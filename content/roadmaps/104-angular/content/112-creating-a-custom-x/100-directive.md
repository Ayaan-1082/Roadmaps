# Directive
Directives are the functions which will execute whenever Angular compiler finds it. Angular Directives enhance the capability of HTML elements by attaching custom behaviors to the DOM.

From the core concept, Angular directives are categorized into three categories.

`Attribute Directives` `Structural Directives` `Components`

# Creating a Custom Attribute Directive
Creating a custom directive is just like creating an Angular component. To create a custom directive we have to replace @Component decorator with @Directive decorator.

So, let's get started with creating our first Custom Attribute directive. In this directive, we are going to highlight the selected DOM element by setting an elementâ€™s background color.
