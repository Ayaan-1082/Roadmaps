# Routing
Routing in Angular allows the users to create a single-page application with multiple views and allows navigation between them. Users can switch between these views without losing the application state and properties

Approach:

Create an Angular app that to be used.
Create the navigation links inside the app component and then provide the “routerLink” directive to each route and pass the route value to “routerLink” directive.
Then add the routes to the routing.module.ts file and then import the routing.module.ts into the app.module.ts file.
