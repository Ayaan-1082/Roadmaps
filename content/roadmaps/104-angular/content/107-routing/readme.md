# Routing

If you want to navigate to different pages in your application, but you also want the application to be a SPA (Single Page Application), with no page reloading, you can use the ngRoute module.

The ngRoute module routes your application to different pages without reloading the entire application.

 - $routeProvider is used to configure the routes. It helps to define what page to display when a user clicks a link. It accepts either when() or otherwise() method.
 - The ngRoute must be added as a dependency in the application module
