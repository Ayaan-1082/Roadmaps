# ORM

Object Relational Mapping, also known as Mapping Tool, in computer science is a programming technique used to convert data between systems of incompatible types through object-oriented programming languages.

In simple terms, it is as if the ORM creates a “virtual database” and reflects this “virtual database” in a traditional database, such as SQL Server for example.
