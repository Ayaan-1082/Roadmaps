GitHub vs GitLab vs BitBucket
Before we get to GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, we must discuss what a version control system is.
Version control systems allow you to track changes to your codebase/files over time. They allow you to go back to some previous version of the codebase without any issues. Also, they help in collaborating with people working on the same code.
Here are three key version control services:
GitHub is a provider of internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features. It's very similar to GitLab, except for one of the major differences is that while GitLab has more features, GitHub has a higher level of infrastructure.
Finally, we have BitBucket, made by Atlassian. It's still very similar to GitHub to where they both have a way of sharing code, but BitBucket is more known for smaller businesses and enterprises.
