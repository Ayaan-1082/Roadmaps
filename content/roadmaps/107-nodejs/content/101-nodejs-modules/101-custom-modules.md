# Custom Modules

Modules are the collection of JavaScript codes in a separate logical file that can be used in external applications on the basis of their related functionality. Modules are popular as they are easy to use and are reusable.

To create a module in Node.js, you will need the exports keyword. This keyword tells Node.js that the function can be used outside the module.
