# Node inspect
Node Inspector is a debugger interface for Node.js applications that uses the Blink Developer Tools (formerly WebKit Web Inspector).
Since version 6.3, Node.js provides a built-in DevTools-based debugger which mostly deprecates Node Inspector. The built-in debugger is developed directly by the V8/Chromium team and provides certain advanced features (e.g. long/async stack traces) that are too difficult to implement in Node Inspector.
