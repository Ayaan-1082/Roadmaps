# Set timeout

The setTimeout function is used to call a function after the specified number of milliseconds. The delay of the called function begins after the remaining statements in the script have finished executing. The setTimeout function is found in the Timers module of Node.js.

The **setTimeout()** function accepts two arguments. The first argument is a function and the second argument is time in milliseconds. The **setTimeout()** executes the function passed in the first argument after the time specified in the second argument. The setTimeout function doesnâ€™t block other code and the rest of the code is executed and after a specified time the code inside setTimeout function is executed.
