# What is System errors

A system error refers to an instruction which cannot be recognized by an operating system or goes against the procedural rules.

A system error code refers to the exact error number with which you can track down the details. Sometimes, youâ€™ll find a short error message after the number to describe the error you met.

A fatal system error (also known as system crash or stop error) appears when your operating system halts. Something goes wrong to prevent your system from loading successfully at that moment. This kind of error often results in a BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death).
