#Programmer Errors

Programmer errors are logical or syntactical problems in programmes that can only be fixed by altering the source code. Because these mistakes are 
programme flaws by definition, they cannot be fixed. Examples of programming mistakes are as follows:

Syntax errors, such as failing to close a curly brace.
Type errors when you try to do something illegal, such as performing operations on operands of mismatched types.
Bad parameters when calling a function.
Reference errors when you misspell a variable, function, or property name.
Trying to access a location beyond the end of an array.
Failing to handle an operational error.
