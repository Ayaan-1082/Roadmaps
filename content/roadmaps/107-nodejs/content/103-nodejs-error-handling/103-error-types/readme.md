# Error types
# JavaScript Error Types
During you are writing a script, you get an error from writing some syntax wrong, or by writing some logic wrong. Or the executes the script and some error occurs.
JavaScript also has some similar errors. And each error comes for a different reason.
 # EvalError
 JavaScript raise the EvalError when you use eval() function in the wrong manner.
 # RangeError
 The RangeError happens when a number is not in its range.
 # ReferenceError
 The ReferenceError raises when you reference a variable, a function, or an object that does not exist.
 # SyntaxError
 The SyntaxError raises in a string that you pass to the eval() function.
 # TypeError
 The TypeError happens if a variable is of an unexpected type or access to a nonexistent method.
 # URIError
 The URIError error raises when using the encodeURI() or decodeURI() with a malformed URI.
 
 # System Errors
 A system error refers to an instruction which cannot be recognized by an operating system or goes against the procedural rules.

A system error code refers to the exact error number with which you can track down the details. Sometimes, youâ€™ll find a short error message after the number to describe the error you met.

A fatal system error (also known as system crash or stop error) appears when your operating system halts. Something goes wrong to prevent your system from loading successfully at that moment. This kind of error often results in a BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death).

An example of a user error is a user who has deleted an important system file because they thought it wasn't important.

# Bad Logic
# Incorrect Formulae
# Coding Errors

# Assertion Error 
Assertion is a programming concept used while writing a code where the user declares a condition to be true using assert statement prior to running the module. If the condition is True, the control simply moves to the next line of code. In case if it is False the program stops running and returns AssertionError Exception.
