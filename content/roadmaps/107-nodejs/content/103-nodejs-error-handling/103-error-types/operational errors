#Opertional errros

Operational errors are largely predictable faults that can happen when an application is being run. 
They could be external factors that interfere with programme execution rather than errors, which are not
always the case. In these situations, it is possible to comprehend the entire consequences of the error and take the necessary action.
some of the examples include
An API request fails for some reason (e.g., the server is down or the rate limit exceeded).
A database connection is lost, perhaps due to a faulty network connection.
The OS cannot fulfill your request to open a file or write to it.
The user sends invalid input to the server, such as an invalid phone number or email address.
