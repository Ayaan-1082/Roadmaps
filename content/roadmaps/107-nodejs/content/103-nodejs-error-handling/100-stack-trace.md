# Stack trace

# What Does Stack Trace Mean?
A stack trace is a report that provides information about program subroutines. It is commonly used for certain kinds of debugging, where a stack trace can help software engineers figure out where a problem lies or how various subroutines work together during execution.

A stack trace is also known as a stack traceback or a stack backtrace.

# Techopedia Explains Stack Trace
A stack trace works on the "call stack," which is a data structure that provides information about the current subroutine of the program being debugged. The call stack is also known simply as the "stack" or the execution stack, runtime stack or machine stack. The stack also provides information about each subroutineâ€™s priorities and how subroutines should be executed.

Stack tracing looks at these subroutines through the stack to analyze what each subroutine contains and how it is run. Software experts define stack trace as a list of the subroutine calls that an application performs during execution.

Stack tracing is important for complex codes because it helps software engineers and other developers find bugs in the program. Because of the nature of modern code syntax, and the complexity of the average project, looking for bugs can be very difficult. Software companies use many different kinds of proactive testing to isolate parts of the software environment to find bugs or glitches. A stack trace is one of many tools that can be useful in comprehensive testing.
