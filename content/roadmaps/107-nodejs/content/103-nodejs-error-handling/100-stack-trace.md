# Stack trace

Node Js  applications often throw errors or exceptions that must be handled.They are handled using the Following.
Stack Trace:
A Stack trace is displayed automatically by the JVM to indicate that an error has occurred during the program execution. The stack trace is used to trace the active stack frames at a particular instance during the execution of a program. The stack trace is useful while debugging code as it shows the exact point that has caused an error
Call Stack:
The call stack is a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure containing the address at which execution will resume and often local variables and parameters from each call
