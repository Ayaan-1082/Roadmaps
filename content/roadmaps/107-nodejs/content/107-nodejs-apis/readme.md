# WHAT IS API?
The API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of commands, functions, or protocols that act as an intermediary that enables two applications to communicate.

# Nodejs apis
Node-API is a toolkit introduced in Node 8.0.0 that acts as an intermediary between C/C++ code and the Node JavaScript engine. It permits C/C++ code to access, create, and manipulate JavaScript objects as if they were created by JavaScript code. Node-API is built into Node versions 8.0.0 and later and requires no further installation.
