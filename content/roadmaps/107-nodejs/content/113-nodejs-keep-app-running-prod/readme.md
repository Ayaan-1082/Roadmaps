# Keep your app running in Production

PM2 lets you run your nodejs scripts forever. In the event that your application crashes, PM2 will also restart it for you.

During development you probably start your Node.js server by opening up the terminal and typing node index.js (or whatever file is the starting point of your application). If this command lives in the package.json file, you run it with NPM using npm start.
