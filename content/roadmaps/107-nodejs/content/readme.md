# What is NodeJS

Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Node.js provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API that optimizes an application's throughput and scalability. These technologies make Node.js well suited for building real-time, high-performance, scalable web applications.

# Why learn Nodejs

There are several reasons why you might want to learn Node.js:

* Node.js is built on top of Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which means that it is very fast and scalable. This makes it a good choice for building high-performance web applications.

* Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

* Node.js allows you to use JavaScript on the backend as well as the frontend of your web application, which can make development more consistent and efficient.

* The Node.js ecosystem includes a large number of useful libraries and frameworks, such as Express.js and Socket.io, that make it easy to build powerful web applications.

* Because Node.js is used by many large and popular websites, such as Netflix, Uber, and eBay, learning it can improve your job prospects and open up new career opportunities.
