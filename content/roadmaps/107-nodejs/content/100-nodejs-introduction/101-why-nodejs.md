# Why nodejs

Node.js is an open source, a server-side script which runs on the top of Google’s open-source scripting engine V8. Node.js is fast, lightweight and efficient. It uses the asynchronous mode of operation, event-driven Input/Output rather than using the traditional threads or separate threads for each process. Node.js was originally written by Ryan Dahl in the year 2009. It is a cross-platform Javascript run-time environment that executes Javascript code outside of a browser. Node.js uses javascript for creating node applications or we can use any other language that ultimately compiles to javascript (like typescript). The javascript is written in the same way as we’d use in any client-side application. However, we need to set up the node development environment.
