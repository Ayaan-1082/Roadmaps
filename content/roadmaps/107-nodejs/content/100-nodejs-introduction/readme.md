# Nodejs introduction

Node.js is currently one of the best options for running backend javascript code.
With it, you can create

- Fully customizable server code, low level or high level it's up to You!
- Bot clients for multiple services such as Twitter, Discord, Twitch, Facebook, etc (list is much longer!)
- Offline applications for console (Node.js itself does not support GUI, but it has a version that does, called NodeGui)
- or even AI projects!
