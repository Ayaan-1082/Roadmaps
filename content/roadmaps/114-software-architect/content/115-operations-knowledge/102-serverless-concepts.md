# Serverless concepts

A cloud-native development methodology called serverless enables developers to create and execute applications without having to worry about managing servers.

In serverless, servers still exist, but they are separated from the app development process. The routine tasks of setting up, maintaining, and scaling the server infrastructure are handled by a cloud provider. For deployment, developers only need to package their code in containers.
