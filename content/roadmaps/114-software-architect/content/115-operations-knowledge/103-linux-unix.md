# Linux / Unix

Knowledge of UNIX is a must for almost all kind of development as most of the codes that you write is most likely going to be finally deployed on a UNIX/Linux machine. Linux has been the backbone of the free and open source software movement, providing a simple and elegant operating system for almost all your needs.

### A brief history
UNIX was earlier known to be UNICS, which stands for UNiplexed Information Computing System. Originally it was targeted for commercial machines and was under a restrictive license. Linus Torvalds later took the initial design in form of the Linux operating system which when added with Richard Stallmanâ€™s GNU toolchain, came to be known as GNU/Linux and it is what we commonly refer to as Linux nowadays. Linux and Mac OS can be considered UNIX-like platforms as most of the concepts are valid here as well.

> The UNIX system basically comprises three components:
* Kernel: The Kernel is responsible for allocating time and memory to programs. It also handles file storage and communication while responding to system calls.
* Shell: It acts as an interface between the kernel and the user. The user has to go under the authentication check before entering into the shell.
* Program: It can be said that everything inside UNIX is either a file or a program. A process is a program under execution having a unique PID(program Identifier), used to identify it.

This much information should be good enough to know what you will be needing UNIX/Linux for. Common use cases can be:
* Running CI/CD pipelines.
* Creating low-footprint docker containers.
* Sever OS for your backend application.

The power of Linux becomes manifold with the toolchain it comes with and the tons of open-source utilities out there and almost all of them are command-line based making it ideal for use over a ssh connection. Some use cases are:
* Reading log files for a specific term or regex pattern.
* File manipulation.
* User access control and security rules.
* Networking with other machines/nodes as part of the application infrastructure.
