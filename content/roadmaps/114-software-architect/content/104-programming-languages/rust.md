#RUST
A multi-paradigm, all-purpose programming language is called Rust. Performance, type safety, and concurrency are highlighted in Rust. Unlike other memory-safe 
languages, Rust maintains memory safety—that is, that all references link to valid memory—without necessitating the employment of a garbage collector or reference
counting. Rust's borrow checker keeps track of the object lifetime and variable scope of all references in a programme during compilation to guarantee memory safety
and stop concurrent data races. Although functional programming structures are among the high-level capabilities offered by Rust, it is mostly used for systems 
development.
