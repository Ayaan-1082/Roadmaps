# Firewalls

A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.

A little Historical Background is really intresting to note, The wall used to contain a fire inside a row of nearby buildings was the original meaning of the term firewall. Later uses refer to comparable constructions, as the metal panel separating the passenger compartment from the engine compartment of a car or an aeroplane. The phrase was used to describe network technology in the late 1980s, a period when the Internet was still relatively undeveloped in terms of connectivity and global use.

A packet filter is the first type of network firewall that has been reported, and it inspects packet data sent between computers. The router maintains an access list that specifies which data packet will be examined and what action, if any, should be taken, with the default action set to silent discard.
