# Reactive functional programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm designed to handle pure mathematical functions. This paradigm is totally focused on writing more compounded and pure functions. Here are some important concepts about functional programming.

- **Declarative**: declarative code that specifies what you want to do, without saying how.
- **Functions are first class citizens**: functions can be assigned to a variable, passed as arguments, returned from other functions, etc. 
- **Pure functions**: functions that, given a specific input, will always return the same output without any side effects.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: function that receives another function as a parameter or returns a function as a return value.
- **Composition**: combining multiple functions such that output of one function is used as input for other function
- **Immutability**: data once defined, cannot be changed.
