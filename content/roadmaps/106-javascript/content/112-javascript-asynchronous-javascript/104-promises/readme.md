# Promises

Promises are a much better way to work with asynchronous code than the old and error-prone callback style. They were introduced into JavaScript with ECMAScript 6. Using promises, we can manage extremely complex asynchronous code with rigorous error-handling set up, write code in a more or less synchronous style, and keep ourselves from running into the so-called callback hell.
