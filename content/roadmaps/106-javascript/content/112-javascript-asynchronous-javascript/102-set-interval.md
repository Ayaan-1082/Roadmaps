# Set interval

The setInterval() method in JavaScript is used to repeat a specified function at every given **time-interval.** It evaluates an expression or calls a function at given intervals. This method continues the calling of function until the window is closed or the clearInterval() method is called. This method returns a numeric value or a non-zero number that identifies the created timer.
