# Omparison operators

Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.  The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. The result returns a Boolean (`true` or `false`).

Comparison operators in Javascript are as follows:



| Symbol                     | Description                                                                                  | Example                   |
| :------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `==` Not Equal             | Returns `true` if operands are equal                                                         | 3 == '3'                  |
| `!=` Not Equal             | Returns `false` if operands are  not equal                                                   | 5 == '99'                 |
| `===` Strict Equal         | Returns `true` if the operands are of same type AND equal.                                   | 5 === 5                   |
| `!==` Strict Not Equal     | Returns `true` if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type. | 3 !== '3'  <br/> 10 !== 5 |
| `>` Greater Than           | Returns `true` if the left operand is greater than the right operand.                        | 6 > 2   <br/> '20' > 10   |
| `>=` Greater Than or Equal | Returns `true` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.            | 7 >= 4 <br/> 7 >= 7       |
| `<` Less Than              | Returns `true` if the left operand is less than the right operand.                           | 3 < 7  <br/>  '6' < 16    |
| `<=` Less Than or Equal    | Returns `true` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.               | 5 < 9 <br/> 7 <= 7        |
