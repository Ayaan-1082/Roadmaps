# Hoisting

JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code. The key difference between var, let and const as it relates to hoisting is that let and const remain uninitialized at execution while var declared variables are initialized with a value of undefined.
