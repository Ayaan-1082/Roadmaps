# Variable Declarations

To use variables in JavaScript, we first need to create it i.e. declare a variable. To declare variables, we use one of the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

However, it should be noted that `var`, `let`, and `const` declare variables in slightly different ways. There are issues associated with variables declared using `var`.

These issues led to the release of `let` and `const` in Javascript ES6.

`let` is now the preferred keyword for variable declarations, while `const` is used to declare variables with values that do not change.
