# Javascript Variables

Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. To store and represent this information in the JavaScript codebase, we use variables. A variable is a container for a value.

For Example:
let num = 5;
num is variable and it's storing value 5.

In JS we either use var or let keyword to declare variables.
var is used in the older versions of JavaScript while let is new way of declaring variables ES6.
var is function scoped and while is block scoped.

JAVASCRIPT Intialize Variables:
let x;
x = 9; //initializing

If you use a variable without initializing it, it will have an undefined value.

Javascript Constants
The const keyword was also introduced int ES6 version
For Example:  cont x = 5;

Once a constant is initialized, we cannot change its value;
