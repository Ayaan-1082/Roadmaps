# Javascript Versions

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich, and in 1997 and became an ECMA standard.

# Verions of ECMAScript (and JavaScript) :- 

With JavaScript now granted Ecma International standardization and the ECMAScript specification, it also needed to follow standard versioning practices. For the first few iterations of the language, this didn't mean much to developers. However, as you will see, as needs grew and the language evolved, major changes would be coming to ECMAScript. They would, in some cases, flow on to JavaScript, and in other cases die altogether.

# ECMAScript 1 (1997)-
The first version to undergo standardization codified its features more or less from LiveScript. This version is sometimes referred to as ECMAScript First Edition.

It generally corresponds to JavaScript version 1.3.

# ECMAScript 2 (1998)-
This release saw few changes aside from edits to better conform with established standards. It should probably have been labeled version 1.1.

It also generally corresponds to JavaScript version 1.3.

# ECMAScript 3 (1999)-
This version of ECMAScript added some fundamental, yet expected (necessary), language enhancements. One of the most important of these is the use of regular expressions (regex), which allows complex pattern matching within text data. The try…catch conditional structure was also introduced, providing an alternative to the more basic if…else statement, allowing more sophisticated error handling. The in operator was also introduced. This generally corresponds to JavaScript version 1.5.

# ECMAScript 4 (unreleased)-
This release included real classes, modules, generators, static typing, and many language features that were added to the specification many years later.

# ECMAScript 5 (2009)-
This version is, in actuality, ECMAScript 3.1, with version 4 completely abandoned. This was more of a politically motived release than anything of substance, though certain bug fixes from ECMAScript 4 were included, along with strict mode, JSON support, and a number of additional methods for working with arrays.

This generally corresponds to JavaScript version 1.8.5 and is the version of JavaScript that conforms to most browsers today.

# ECMAScript 6 (2015)-
Features including arrow functions, maps, typed-arrays, promises, and many more were introduced with this version of ECMAScript, and many of them form the basis for modern development with JavaScript today. This specification also allows for the writing of classes and modules—finally.

# ECMAScript 7 (2016), ECMAScript 8 (2017), and ECMAScript 9 (2018)-
All versions post2015 have been incremental, with yearly modifications to what was established in ECMAScript 6
