# XMLHttpRequest

XMLHttpRequest is a built-in browser object that allows making HTTP requests in JavaScript. Although the name uses XML, it can be used to make an API call returning any data. It is on the decline in modern codebases in favor of more modern fetch API but is often found in legacy codebases.
