# Function borrowing

**_Method borrowing_**, also known as function borrowing, is a technique where a method of one object is used on another object. This is possible because JavaScript functions are objects and can be passed around like any other object.

In JavaScript, we can reuse the method of a function on a different object other than the object it was defined on. Method borrowing helps to keep us from having to write the same code multiple times. Using the predefined JavaScript methods, `call()`, `apply()` or `bind()`, we can borrow methods from other objects without inheriting their properties and methods.
