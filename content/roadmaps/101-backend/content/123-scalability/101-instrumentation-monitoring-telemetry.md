# Instrumentation Monitoring Telemetry

Instrumentation refers to the measure of a product's performance, in order to diagnose errors and to write trace information. Instrumentation can be of two types: source instrumentation and binary instrumentation.

Backend monitoring allows the user to view the performance of infrastructure ? that is, the components that run a web application. These include the HTTP server, middleware, database, third party API services, and more.

Telemetry is the automated communication processes from multiple data sources. Telemetry data is used to improve customer experiences, monitor security, application health, quality, and performance.
