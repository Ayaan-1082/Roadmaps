# Mitigation strategies

## Graceful Degradation


## Throttling 
Throttling is used to prevent resource usage from ballooing out of control and to control the consumption of resources. One way it does this is by limiting the amount of requests a client can make. Often, throttling is determined by two different rates, a *burst* rate and a *sustained* rate. The burst rate applies over a short period of time, while the sustained rate applies over a longer period.

## Loadshifting


## Circuit Breaker
