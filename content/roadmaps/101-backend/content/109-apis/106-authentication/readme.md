# Authentication

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)—the vital links that allow applications to exchange services and data—require authentication before the exchange can take place. If a client application tries to access another application, the target API wants to know: Is the client really the client it claims to be?

The API authentication process validates the identity of the client attempting to make a connection by using an authentication protocol. The protocol sends the credentials from the remote client requesting the connection to the remote access server in either plain text or encrypted form. The server then knows whether it can grant access to that remote client or not.

That’s essentially what API authentication is all about. The system needs to make sure each end-user is properly validated. The system also wants to make sure the client system does not represent someone who has accidentally tried to access a service they are not entitled to, or worse—the system of a cybercriminal trying to hack into the system.
