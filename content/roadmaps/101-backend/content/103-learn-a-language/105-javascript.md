# JavaScript

   JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to add interactivity to your websites and web-apps. Common examples that you may have seen on the websites are sliders, click interactions, pop-ups among others. Apart from being used on the frontend in browser, there is NodeJS. 

What exactly is Node.js and how is it used on the backend ?
   A very common definition on the internet is "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime ENVIRONMENT that runs on the v8 engines and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser" but what exactly does this mean ? NodeJS allows you to write JavaScript code on the server.  
NodeJS eases handling multiple requests made by the client and enables code sharing and re-usage of library codes.

The apps respond immediately and work within the allotted time.
Its single-threaded functionality is best suited for real-time communication.


Using NodeJS, programmers can create JavaScript code for both client- and server-side applications. Being a Full-Stack developer has gotten much simpler since NodeJS was created because you can now write JavaScript on both the server-side and client-side.

Another noteworthy improvement is the widespread adoption of NodeJS by enormous corporations. (Among others, Netflix, Uber, and LinkedIn)
