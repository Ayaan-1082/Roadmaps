# Accessibility
Web accessibility (also shortened to "a11y") means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed in such a way that people with disabilities can use them easily. Accessibility also benefits people <em>without</em> disabilities. It is the practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction or access to websites by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed.

By creating an accessible web, it allows the use of assistive technologies to navigate through a website. Some examples of assistive technologies include:

- screen readers
- magnification
- use of keyboard navigation
