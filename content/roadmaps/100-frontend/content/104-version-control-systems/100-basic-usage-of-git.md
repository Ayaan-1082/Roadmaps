# Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git helps in tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems). Git allows you to upload your code on cloud, share it with other people allowing them to make changes, without disturbing the main branch, unless accepted.
