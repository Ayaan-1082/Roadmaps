# Task runners

In short, the CSS should go through some optimizations before going into production. That's where the "Task Runners" come in, which are nothing more than workflows to optimize/transpile/minify/etc the CSS code before it goes into production.
What has gained more space in the last few are NPM scripts are simple and scalable, and have been shown to be an efficient solution for solving many problems.
