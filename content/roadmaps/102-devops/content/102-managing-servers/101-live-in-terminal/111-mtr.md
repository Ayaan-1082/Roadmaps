# Mtr
`mtr` (Matt Traceroute) is a CLI that merges traceroute and ping as a network diagnostic. Using MTR, we can identify connection problems between two routers. MTR support for checking IPv4, and IPv6 using ICMPv6.

It has to follow this syntax:  
`$ mtr [option] [hostname]/[path]`

e.g `$ mtr google.com`
