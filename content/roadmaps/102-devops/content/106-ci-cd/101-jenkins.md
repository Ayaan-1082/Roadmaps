# Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source CI/CD automation server. It is primarily used for building projects, running tests, static code analysis and deployments.
It offers a simple way to set up a continuous integration/ continuous delivery (CI/CD) environment for almost any combination of languages and source code repositories using pipleines, as well as automating other routine development tasks. While Jenkins doesn't eliminate the need to create scripts for individuals steps, it does give you a faster and more active way to integrate your entire chain of build, test and deployment tools than you can easily build yourself.    

## How Jenkins Works

Jenkins works as a server on a variety of platforms including Windows, MacOs, Unix variants especially Linux. It requires a Java 8 VM and above and can be run on the Oracle JRE or OpenJDK. Usually Jenkins runs as a Java servlet within a Jetty application server. It can be run on other Java application servers such as Apache Tomcat. more recently, Jenkins has been asapted to run in a Docker container.
