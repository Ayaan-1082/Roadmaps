# CI/CD

CI/CD is a major set of practices used in devops which aims at frequently delivering service to customers by automating the stages involved during development. CI/CD combines Continuos Integration and Continuos Delivery and automates the manual labour generally involved traditionally in pushing code from commit to production like building, testing and deploying. As a result, developers can push changes to the codebase which will then be pulled by the automation server, tested automatically and released for deployment. Automated pipelines remove errors that might be made manually, provide standardized feedback loops to developers and enable fast product iterations in a single environment. This ensures faster and more efficient delivery of service to clients.
