# Middleware

Middleware is a full-stack, cloud-native observability platform that provides infrastructure monitoring, container monitoring, log monitoring and APM. The tool uses its own agents to collect and process the data.  

Middleware allows you to analyze, diagnose & predict issues across your entire infrastructure, so you can act upon errors before they become a disaster.
