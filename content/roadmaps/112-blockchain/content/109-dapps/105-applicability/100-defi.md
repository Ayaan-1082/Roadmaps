# DeFi

Defi or Decentralized finance is built on three main pillers, Cryptography, Smart contracts, and Blockchain. Unlike Cefi or centralized finance like banks, which handles all the transactions in a centralized manner. In Defi, this process is done by using smart contracts, which provide complete transparency and ownership.
In Cefi, real life assets are used, but in Defi, cryptographic assets are used, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and etc.

In Defi, there's no need of KYC, it has censorship resistance and also its not country limited, its global so that transactions can happen world wide without any barrier.
Defis are transparent and hence provide ownership to the customer.
