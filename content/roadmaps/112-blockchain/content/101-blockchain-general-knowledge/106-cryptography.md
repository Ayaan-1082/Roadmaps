# Cryptography

Cryptography, or cryptology, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. 
In Cryptography the techniques which are use to protect informatioon are obtaied from mathematica concepts and set of rule based calculations known as algorithms to convert messages in ways that make it hard to decode it.
These algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification, to protect data privace, web browsing on internet and to protect confidential transactions such as credit card and debit card transactions.

# Features of Cryptography are:
1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Non-repudiation
4. Authentication

# Types of Cryptography:
1. Symmetric Key Cryptography
2. Hash function
3. Asymmetric Key Cryptography
