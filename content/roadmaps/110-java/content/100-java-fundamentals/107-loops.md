# Loops
**In Java programming language and also in other programming languages, loops are used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop.**

**There are three types of loops in Java:**
1. **for loop:** A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to be executed a specific number of times. A for loop is useful when you know how many times a task is to be repeated.
2. **while loop:** When the number of iterations is not fixed and we need to iterate over a given sequence until some condition is true, In such scenario we use while loops.
3. **do-while loop:** This loop is similar as of the while loop but, use it if the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once.
