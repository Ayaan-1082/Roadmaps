# Basic Syntax

Understanding the basics is the key to a solid foundation. In this section, learn the basic terminologies, naming conventions, reserved words, conditions, functions, data structures, OOP, packages, etc.

* To print output we can use --> System.out.println(); or System.out.print(); or System.out.printf();
* To take input from user --> Scanner or BufferedReader or Console class can be used

# Java Basic Syntax Rules

* The file name must be identical to the class name.
* Most often each class is in a separate file with a .java extension. Class files are usually grouped into folders. These folders are called packages.
* Characters are case sensitive. Eg. String is not equal to string.
* The beginning of java program processing always starts in the main method: public static void main (String [] args). The main method is the required part of any Java program
* Method (procedure, function) is a sequence of commands. Methods define the behaviour of an object.
* The order of the methods in the program file is irrelevant.
* The first letter of a class name is in uppercase.
* The names of all methods in Java syntax begin with a lowercase letter. When using multiple words, the subsequent letters are capitalized.
* Files are saved with class name and .java extension.
* In Java syntax, there are delimiters "{...}" that denote a block of code and a new area of code.
* Each code statement must end with a semicolon.
