# Basic Syntax

Understanding the basics is the key to a solid foundation. In this section, learn the basic terminologies, naming conventions, reserved words, conditions, functions, data structures, OOP, packages, etc.It

When we consider a Java program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what do class, object, methods, and instance variables mean.

1. Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

2. Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.

3. Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.

4. Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.
