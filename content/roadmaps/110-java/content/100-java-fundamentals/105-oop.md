# OOP

Object-oriented programming is a core of Java Programming, which is used for designing a program using classes and objects. This can also be characterized as data controlling for accessing the code.
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
