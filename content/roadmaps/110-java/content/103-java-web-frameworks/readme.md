# Java web frameworks

Frameworks are tools with pre-written code, that act as a template or skeleton, which can be reused to create an application by simply filling with your code as needed which enables developers to program their application with no overhead of creating each line of code again and again from scratch.

Java Frameworks are software tools capable of adding additional functionality to your code to make things look more comfortable. They may include predefined classes (such as categories of objects) and functions that can be used to process, input, and manage hardware devices, as well as interact with system software depending upon the type of framework and our preferences.
