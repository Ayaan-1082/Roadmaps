# JPA
The Jakarta Persistence API provides Java developers with an object/relational mapping facility for managing relational data in Java applications.
JPA is not a tool nor a framework, but a set of interfaces for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and (a) relational database. Because it is a set of interfaces, it will require an implementation to work with and persist Java objects. This will be ORM.

*Note: In 2019, JPA was renamed from Java Persistence API to Jakarta Persistence.*
