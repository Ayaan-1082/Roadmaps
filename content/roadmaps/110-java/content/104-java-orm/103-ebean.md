# Ebean

- Ebean is an objectâ€“relational mapping product written in Java. It is designed to be simpler to use and understand than JPA (Java Persistence API) or JDO (Java Data Objects) products.
- Ebean has a simpler API than JPA. It achieves this through its 'Session Less' architecture.
- Ebean uses the same mapping as JPA with its @Entity, @Table, @OneToMany etc. annotations and xml. The mapping of Entity beans should be compatible between Ebean and JPA.
