# Mocking
Mocking is a way of removing external dependencies from a unit test so as to create a sense of an entire controlled environment.The traditional way of using mocks invovles mocking all other classes that interact with the class that we want to test. The common targets for mocking are
- Database connections
- Web services
- Classes that are slow
- Classes with side effects
- Classes with non-deterministic behavior
