# Cucumber jvm

Cucumber is an open-source software test automation framework for behavior-driven development. It uses a business-readable, domain-specific language called Gherkin for specifying feature behaviors that become tests. The Cucumber project started in 2008 when Aslak Helles√∏y released the first version of the Cucumber framework for Ruby.
