# Cucumber JVM

Cucumber-JVM is the official port for Java. Every Gherkin step is “glued” to a step definition method that executes the step. The English text of a step is glued using annotations and regular expressions. Cucumber-JVM integrates nicely with other testing packages. Anything that can be done with Java can be handled by Cucumber-JVM. Cucumber-JVM is ideal for black-box, above-unit, functional tests.
