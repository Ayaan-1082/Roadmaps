Quality Assurance (QA) is also known as QA testing. QA will aim as an activity to ensure that an organization provides the best product or service to the customers. QA testing of a software involves the testing of performance, adaptability, and functionality. Yet, software quality assurance extends beyond software quality; it also comprises the quality process used for developing, testing, and release of software products. QA relies on the software development cycle, which includes the management of software requirements, design, coding, testing, and release.
