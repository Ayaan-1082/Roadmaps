# Test Prioritization

The term “Test prioritization” refers to one of the most challenging tasks of software testing that allows testers to manage risks, plan tests, consider cost values, and analyze the tests to be run in the context of a particular project. 

This process of managing, scheduling, and listing the test cases as per their priority levels are also known as test case prioritization.

With the help of test case prioritization, testers and developers will be able to minimize the time and cost of the software testing phase and will easily ensure that the delivered product is of exceptional quality.
