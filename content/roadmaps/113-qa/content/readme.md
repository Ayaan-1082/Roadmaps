The Role of Quality Engineer
First of all, what is a “quality engineer”?

While there are many ways to build software, we believe it is best created by small, cross-functional, collaborative teams. The ‘cross-functional’ characteristic describes a team has all the roles and skills necessary to build the solution, without reliance on external teams or skillsets.

One role within these teams is the quality engineer (QE). QEs are more than just testers or automators, they empower teams by bringing a quality mindset to every aspect of building software. They are experts in quality assurance, test automation, risk analysis, agile processes, CI/CD, and everything else that can impact product quality. They collaborate with all other roles to ensure quality is built-in from day one, from the first story, before the first line of code is written. Some companies call this role an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test), but every company defines roles differently, so what an SDET or QE does at one company might not exactly match the next.

While this roadmap was constructed specifically for our quality engineer role, it will be relevant to anyone looking to start a career in a quality related field, regardless of the name or title.

Quality Engineering Learning Roadmap
While we originally sought to keep our Quality Engineer Roadmap simple, the number of topics and skills was so large that we decided to first organize it into general areas of study. As you can see in the diagram below, there are hundreds of individual topics, all organized into a more manageable set of eighteen sections. Don’t get too caught up with the full view now, as we‘ll walk through each section individually.
