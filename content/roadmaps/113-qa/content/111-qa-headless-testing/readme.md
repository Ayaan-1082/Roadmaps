# Qa headless testing
Headless testing is when end-to-end tests are preformed without loading the browser's user interface. Since the browser operates as a typical browser would, but does not make use of the user interface, it is considered highly suitable for automated testing.

A few example cases where one may use headless browser testing include:
- Automation of HTML event responses, such as form submission, keyboard events, mouse-clicking, and etc.
- Web scraping
- Generating screenshots of webpages
