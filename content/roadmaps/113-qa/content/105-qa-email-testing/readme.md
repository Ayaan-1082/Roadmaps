# Qa email testing
# What does email QA testing mean?
The most basic definition of email QA testing includes making sure your email is going to show up in the inbox (and function) as you intend. That includes confirming that:
⁕ Email templates and headers/footers are functioning
⁕ Email copy and content is error-free
⁕ Links in email copy, calls to action, images and buttons direct as intended
⁕ Email content renders properly in various email clients 
⁕ The email is accessible

# Email QA process
The email testing and QA process is rarely a one-person show. Based on the complexity of your email campaigns and the size of your organization, it will likely involve sign off from a number of stakeholders, both in and outside of your email marketing team.
