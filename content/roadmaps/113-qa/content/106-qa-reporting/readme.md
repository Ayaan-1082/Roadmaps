# Qa reporting
A test summary report is a detailed overview that holds every important detail identified and discovered from different testing stages. The undeniable reason is to deliver the high/low performance of the software to the respective stakeholders. So, the basic idea is to add value to their decision making whether to go live or not.
And it indeed enables the project stakeholders to assess the test plan execution, ensuring transparency and accountability.

The report would include the quality of the software in different environments, quality of testing efforts, and statistics obtained from incident reports.
## How to create An Outline Of The Test Report
Generally, this may differ from company to company based on your testing exercises. However, there are a few traditional essentials of a test summary report, as stated below.

A short evaluation of how well the testing is performed.
Quality of testing effort.
Quality assessment of the software.
The recordings should also include different factors like the time taken, different environments tested.

# 2. Purpose
Mention a short explanation of the objective behind making the report. Example: “The following report is a brief of all the insights uncovered during different testing phases of the ABC project.”
# 3. Software/Product Overview
Consider it as a short intro of the product.
# 4. Objective And Testing Scope
This segment allows the stakeholders to understand the functions in scope and out of scope for testing. Information on items not tested and also why aren’t they tested. Restrictions, hurdles, and learnings in each stage are also mentioned.
# 5. Magical Metrics
So far, the most interesting and important one. The critical metrics in visual representation allows a requisite understanding of some complex data. The graphics, in general, are the best for a better understanding of anything.
