# Qa wolf

QA Wolf is for busy teams who want the fastest way to set up tests. We built it for developers like us who want to spend less time testing and more time shipping.

In our previous jobs, we found browser testing too difficult and often gave up on it entirely. Our inspiration for QA Wolf was to build what we wish we'd had. QA Wolf provides everything you need for testing, with no installation or setup required.

Our goal is to get you up and running with tests as quickly as possible. In order to do this, QA Wolf needs to be opinionated. We optimize for speed and ease of use over configuration. QA Wolf works particularly well with the modern Jamstack.
