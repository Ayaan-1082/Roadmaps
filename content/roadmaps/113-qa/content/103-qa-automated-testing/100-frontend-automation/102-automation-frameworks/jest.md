# Jest

Jest is a popular test framework for JavaScript. It claims to provide “delightful JavaScript testing” and, after our tutorial, I bet you might agree with this claim! Jest prides itself in offering a complete and hassle-free experience.The completeness comes from the fact that Jest doesn’t rely on third-party tools for much of its functionality, like some competitors do. And the hassle-free part is due to Jest’s zero configuration setup. You can install it and start writing your first test in no time
