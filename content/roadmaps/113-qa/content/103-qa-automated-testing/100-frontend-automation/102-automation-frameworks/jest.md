Jest is a popular test framework for JavaScript.It can be used in projects that use webpack to manage assets, styles, and compilation. webpack does offer some unique challenges over other tools.Jest prides itself in offering a complete and hassle-free experience.The completeness comes from the fact that Jest doesn’t rely on third-party tools for much of its functionality. And the hassle-free part is due to Jest’s zero configuration setup. You can install it and start writing your first test in no time
