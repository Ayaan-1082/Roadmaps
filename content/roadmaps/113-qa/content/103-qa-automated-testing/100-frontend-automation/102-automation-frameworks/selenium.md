# Selenium
Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Perl, Python, and C#, among others.

Note: To get started with Selenium latest version (WebDriver-based implementation), you'll only need a single selenium jar file (selenium-standalone-server-'{'version'}'.jar) to run tests both locally and on remote devices. This JAR file contains W3C-standard WebDriver API and Selenium Grid, along with Selenium Server (for existing users of deprecated Selenium RC implementation).
