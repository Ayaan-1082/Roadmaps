# What is Backend?
The term backend generally refers to server-side deployment. Here the process is entirely happening in the backend which is not shown to the user only the expected results will be shown to the user. In every web application, there will be a backend language to accomplish the task.
For Example, while uploading the details of the students in the database, the database will store all the details. When there is a need to display the details of the students, it will simply fetch all the details and display them. Here, it will show only the result, not the process and how it fetches the details. 

# Backend automation
Back-end automation is commonly known as workload automation or sometimes referred to as API automation because it leverages application programming interfaces for specifically-defined, high-capacity transactions.
