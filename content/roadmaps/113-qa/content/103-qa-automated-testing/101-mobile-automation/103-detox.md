# Detox

High velocity native mobile development requires us to adopt continuous integration workflows, which means our reliance on manual QA has to drop significantly. Detox tests your mobile app while itâ€™s running in a real device/simulator, interacting with it just like a real user.

It's primary foucs is on "Gray box end-to-end testing and automation framework for React Native apps"

## Key Features of Detox

**Cross Platform:** Write cross-platform tests in JavaScript. Currently supports iOS and Android.

**Runs on Devices (not yet supported on iOS):** Gain confidence to ship by testing your app on a device/simulator just like a real user.

**Automatically Synchronized:** Stops flakiness at the core by monitoring asynchronous operations in your app.

**Made For CI:** Execute your E2E tests on CI platforms like Travis without grief.

**Test Runner Independent:** Use Jest, Mocha, AVA, or any other JavaScript test runner you like (spoiler: we have our favorite).

**Debuggable:** Modern async-await API allows breakpoints in asynchronous tests to work as expected.
