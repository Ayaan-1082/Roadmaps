It is composable: Composition is a function of combining parts or elements to form a whole. In the old days of web development a website was usually a single html page. So, a lot of time those web pages ended up being very long with thousands of lines of HTML codes. With modern frameworks like React, we can divide these codes and put it in custom components. Then we can utilize these components and integrate them into one place. Hence the code becomes a lot more maintainable and flexible. JSX is used for templating in React. JSX is a simple JavaScript that permits HTML quotation elements and uses these HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents.
