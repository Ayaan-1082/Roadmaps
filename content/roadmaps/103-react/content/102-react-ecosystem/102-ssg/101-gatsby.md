# Gatsby

Gatsby is a React-based open source framework with performance, scalability and security built-in.
Gatsby  helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. Gatsby allows the developers to make a site using React and work with any data source (CMSs, Markdown, etc) of their choice. And then at the build time it pulls the data from these sources and spits out a bunch of static files that are optimized by Gatsby for performance. Gatsby loads only the critical HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that the site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around the site feels incredibly fast.
