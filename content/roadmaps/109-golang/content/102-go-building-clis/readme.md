# Go building clis

## CLI developers prefer Go for portability, performance, and ease of creation
Command line interfaces (CLIs), unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), are text-only. Cloud and infrastructure applications are primarily CLI-based due to their easy automation and remote capabilities.

## Key benefits
### Leverage fast compile times to build programs that start quickly and run on any system
Developers of CLIs find Go to be ideal for designing their applications; from a single Windows or Mac laptop, developers can build a Go program for every one of the dozens of architectures and operating systems Go supports in a matter of seconds.

Go applications are built into a single self contained binary making installing Go applications trivial; specifically, programs written in Go run on any system without requiring any existing libraries, runtimes, or dependencies. And programs written in Go have an immediate startup timeâ€”similar to C or C++ but unobtainable with other programming languages.
