# Go api clients
The Kubernetes programming interface in Go mainly consists of the k8s.io/client-go library (for brevity we will just call it client-go going forward). client-go is a typical web service client library that supports all API types that are officially part of Kubernetes. It can be used to execute the usual REST verbs:

1-Create
2-Get
3-List
4-Update
5-Delete
6-Patch
